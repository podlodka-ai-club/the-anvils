"""M1 cross-host **compose-driven** smoke (real ``docker-compose`` + worker restart).

This is the heavyweight sibling of
``tests/integration/test_phase6_cross_host.py``. The cheap test stays
in-process (uvicorn + 2 ``whilly-worker`` subprocesses against a
testcontainers Postgres) and runs on every CI invocation. THIS file
literally drives ``docker-compose`` against the two M1 deployment
artefacts:

* ``docker-compose.control-plane.yml`` (postgres + control-plane on a
  Compose-managed network labelled by the project name)
* ``docker-compose.worker.yml`` (single worker on a *separate*
  Compose-managed network, talking to the control-plane via the host
  port mapping just like the cross-host VPS demo does in production)

What the compose-based gate proves on top of the cheap one
----------------------------------------------------------
1. The two compose files actually boot to a healthy state under
   ``docker-compose -f <file> up -d`` (with no manual flag soup).
2. The control-plane and worker can talk to each other across two
   *distinct* docker networks — i.e. the worker is NOT on the
   control-plane's private network; it reaches the API through the
   host port mapping (``WHILLY_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0`` + the worker's
   ``WHILLY_CONTROL_URL=http://<host-gateway>:<port>``). This is
   exactly the cross-host VPS topology described in
   ``docs/Distributed-Setup.md``.
3. A worker container that is **stopped and started again** mid-flight
   correctly re-engages the plan: any tasks the first worker
   incarnation had claimed but not completed must be released by the
   visibility-timeout sweeper (or returned via SIGTERM RELEASE), and
   the second incarnation must claim+complete the rest. The audit log
   captures a clean RELEASE→CLAIM transition for every still-pending
   task at restart time.
4. The plan reaches DONE with ≥ 2 distinct ``worker_id`` rows on the
   ``workers`` table sharing the SAME ``hostname`` — i.e. the
   re-registered worker preserves operator-meaningful identity even
   though the per-incarnation token / id rotates each time the
   container starts (the bootstrap-token register flow mints a fresh
   id per ``register`` call).
5. There are no orphan claims when the run finishes — ``tasks.status``
   is ``DONE`` for every row in the plan; there is nothing stuck at
   ``CLAIMED`` or ``IN_PROGRESS``.

Tech-debt fixes (misc-m1-phase6-cross-host-compose-timeout)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Two pre-existing failures were resolved together:

1. **30s pytest timeout was too tight.** Compose stack bringup +
   image start + healthcheck + first-batch drain + worker restart +
   second-batch drain genuinely needs > 30s on a cold colima/Docker
   Desktop. The default `pytest tests/integration/ -q --timeout=30`
   never selects this test (it's behind ``-m compose``), so the
   default sweep is unaffected, but the per-test marker below
   guarantees the budget when an operator opts in via ``-m compose``.

2. **Worker URL guard rejected plain-HTTP host.docker.internal.**
   The worker's URL scheme guard refuses plain HTTP to a non-loopback
   host unless ``--insecure`` is passed (or ``WHILLY_INSECURE=1`` is
   set). The compose worker stack here talks to the control-plane via
   ``http://host.docker.internal:<port>`` — explicitly non-loopback —
   so we must opt the worker container into the insecure mode and
   into the connect-flow code path that honours the env switch.
   Both env vars are propagated through ``docker-compose.worker.yml``
   (see the ``WHILLY_INSECURE`` / ``WHILLY_USE_CONNECT_FLOW``
   passthroughs there).

Skipping policy
---------------
This test is **opt-in** by design:

* It is marked ``@pytest.mark.compose``. Default ``pytest`` runs do
  NOT pick it up; pass ``-m compose`` (or ``-m "not compose"`` to
  exclude it explicitly when running the full suite).
* If the Docker daemon is unreachable, ``docker-compose`` is missing,
  or ``docker info`` exits non-zero, the test ``pytest.skip``s with a
  clear message — it never *fails* due to environment unavailability.
* Building / pulling a current ``whilly`` image is the operator's
  responsibility. By default this test pulls the published image from
  Docker Hub (``${WHILLY_IMAGE:-mshegolev/whilly:4.6.1}``, kept in
  lock-step with the default in ``docker-compose.control-plane.yml``
  and ``docker-compose.worker.yml``), but the environment variable
  can point at any locally-built tag (e.g. ``WHILLY_IMAGE=whilly:dev``).
  Note: the image MUST contain ``/opt/whilly/tests/fixtures/fake_claude_demo.sh``
  which the worker compose file uses as the default ``CLAUDE_BIN``;
  pre-v4.6 release images do not ship that fixture and will cause the
  worker to bail with "claude binary not found". When the image is not
  present locally AND cannot be pulled (offline laptop, private registry
  without credentials, etc.), the compose ``up`` step fails fast and the
  test ``pytest.skip``s with the captured stderr so it is visible WHY
  the gate did not run.

Hermetic by construction (project-name isolation)
-------------------------------------------------
The two compose stacks use **distinct, randomised project names** so
this test never collides with:

* an operator's ad-hoc ``docker-compose -f docker-compose.control-plane.yml up`` left
  running in another shell,
* the long-lived ``docker-compose.demo.yml`` stack (different project
  name regardless),
* a previous failed run of this same test (each run gets a fresh
  random suffix so leftover containers / volumes are namespaced).

The fixture's teardown unconditionally calls ``docker-compose ... down -v``
on both project names so volumes are pruned even when the test fails
mid-flight. The ``compose_project_names`` are also returned so a
diagnosing developer can re-run ``docker-compose -p <name> logs`` if
the test fails.

The PATH-pollution hardening from
``test_phase6_cross_host.py::_resolve_worker_command`` is preserved —
this file runs Python *only* to seed Postgres and parse the audit log;
the worker process itself runs INSIDE the container, so its module
lookup is governed by the production image's venv (``/opt/venv``),
not by the developer's PATH.

    Flow:

      1. (fixture) ``docker-compose up -d`` the control-plane stack on
         project ``<prefix>-cp-<rand>`` (its own network), exposing the
         API on a free host port. Wait for ``/health``.
      2. (fixture) ``docker-compose up -d`` the worker stack on project
         ``<prefix>-w-<rand>`` (its own network). The worker container
         auto-registers via the bootstrap-token entrypoint branch.
      3. Connect to postgres on the host-published port and seed
         5 PENDING tasks under ``PLAN_ID``.
      4. Wait for at least ``TASKS_BEFORE_RESTART`` to reach DONE (so we
         know the worker is genuinely engaged before we restart it).
      5. ``docker-compose stop worker`` — kill the running incarnation.
         Visibility-timeout sweeper releases any of its CLAIMED tasks
         back to PENDING.
      6. ``docker-compose up -d worker`` — start a fresh incarnation.
         Bootstrap-register mints a new ``worker_id`` but the
         ``hostname`` column stays ``WORKER_HOSTNAME`` (the operator-
         meaningful identity).
      7. Wait for all 5 tasks to land in DONE.
      8. Assert: the audit log shows ≥ 1 RELEASE event followed by a
         CLAIM event for some task that the first incarnation had
         taken (clean transition).
      9. Assert: ≥ 2 distinct ``worker_id`` values are in the
         ``workers`` table sharing ``hostname=WORKER_HOSTNAME`` —
         proving the second incarnation re-registered under the same
         hostname.
      10. Assert: no orphan tasks remain (no PENDING / CLAIMED /
         IN_PROGRESS / FAILED / SKIPPED in the plan).

    The PATH-pollution hardening from
    ``test_phase6_cross_host._resolve_worker_command`` is preserved by
    construction here — the worker process runs INSIDE the production
    image, where the ``/opt/venv/bin/whilly-worker`` binary is the only
    one on PATH.
