"""Integration tests for the task-facing HTTP routes (TASK-021c1 / TASK-021c2, PRD FR-1.1 / FR-1.3 / FR-2.4 / TC-6).

This module exercises ``POST /tasks/claim`` and the terminal-state
``POST /tasks/{task_id}/complete`` / ``POST /tasks/{task_id}/fail``
endpoints end-to-end against a real Postgres (testcontainers). The
unit tests in :mod:`tests.unit.test_transport_server` already cover
``create_app``'s construction-time validation; this suite is the
load-bearing contract that the long-poll loop really polls, the SQL
really fires, 204 is the canonical "no work right now" outcome,
terminal-state RPCs flip the row in the database, and the 409
``ErrorResponse`` envelope carries the full :class:`VersionConflictError`
payload the remote worker (TASK-022a3 / 022b1) branches on.

What's covered
--------------
* ``POST /tasks/claim`` returns 200 + the claimed :class:`TaskPayload`
  when a PENDING row exists. The repository state matches what the
  worker (TASK-022b1) will rely on: status flipped to ``CLAIMED`` in
  the database, ``version`` advanced by one, ``claimed_by`` set to
  the request's ``worker_id``.
* ``POST /tasks/claim`` returns 204 No Content when no PENDING rows
  exist for ``plan_id`` after the long-poll budget expires (the AC's
  load-bearing case for TASK-022b1's "204 → re-poll" branch).
* Long-polling really *polls* — when a task is seeded mid-poll, the
  same handler picks it up before the timeout fires.
* Bearer token is required on every task RPC (401 without; 401 with
  the bootstrap secret) — symmetric with the heartbeat tests' PRD
  FR-1.2 split.
* ``POST /tasks/{task_id}/complete`` flips an IN_PROGRESS row to
  DONE, advances the version, and returns the post-update payload.
* ``POST /tasks/{task_id}/fail`` accepts a ``reason``, flips a
  CLAIMED *or* IN_PROGRESS row to FAILED, advances the version,
  appends the reason to ``events.payload``.
* ``POST /tasks/{task_id}/release`` (TASK-022b3, PRD FR-1.6, NFR-1)
  flips a CLAIMED *or* IN_PROGRESS row back to PENDING, clears
  ``claimed_by`` / ``claimed_at``, advances the version, and writes
  a ``RELEASE`` event with the worker-supplied reason — the HTTP
  analogue of :meth:`TaskRepository.release_task` used by the remote
  worker on graceful shutdown.
* :class:`whilly.adapters.db.VersionConflictError` maps to 409 with a
  fully-populated :class:`ErrorResponse` envelope on stale-version
  and wrong-status calls — the contract TASK-022a3 reads.
* Empty / malformed body is rejected by pydantic (422).

Why integration, not unit
-------------------------
Same rationale as :mod:`tests.integration.test_transport_workers`: the
contract under test is "the handler claims a real row, advances its
version, and returns it" — mocking the repository would assert on
*method-call shape* instead of the actual DB transition, which is the
opposite of what these ACs care about.

Long-poll budget for tests
--------------------------
We pass ``claim_long_poll_timeout=0.3`` and
``claim_poll_interval=0.05`` to :func:`create_app` so the timeout
case lands in well under a second. The production defaults (30s /
1.5s) are exercised by the unit tests — making the integration suite
wait 30 seconds per timeout test would dominate runtime without
adding signal.
