"""Unit tests for :mod:`whilly.adapters.transport.server` (TASK-021a3, PRD FR-1.2 / TC-6).

The server module is the composition root of the control-plane HTTP API:
it wires the asyncpg pool, the auth dependencies and (in TASK-021b/c) the
worker-facing routes into a single FastAPI app via :func:`create_app`.
For TASK-021a3 the surface is intentionally narrow — factory + ``/health``
+ ``/docs`` — and these tests pin exactly that surface so later
extensions don't accidentally break the public contract.

What we cover here
------------------
* :func:`create_app` returns a FastAPI app with the routes wired:
  ``/health`` (pinging the pool), ``/docs`` (Swagger UI),
  ``/openapi.json`` (the spec).
* ``/health`` returns 200 ``{"status": "ok"}`` against a healthy pool,
  503 against a pool whose ``acquire()`` / ``fetchval()`` raises, and
  503 if ``SELECT 1`` returns something other than ``1`` (defence-in-
  depth path that would normally only trigger against a misconfigured
  proxy or a buggy test stub).
* ``/health`` requires no ``Authorization`` header — sending one with a
  wrong token still returns 200, because /health predates auth on the
  request flow (PRD: probe must work without credentials).
* :func:`create_app` token resolution: explicit kwarg wins; missing
  kwargs fall back to env; missing env *and* missing kwarg raises
  :class:`RuntimeError` with a message that names the env var so
  operators don't have to grep.
* ``/docs`` and ``/openapi.json`` are reachable without auth — operators
  expect them on the FastAPI defaults.

How we test without a real Postgres
-----------------------------------
The factory's only dependency on asyncpg is the ``pool.acquire()`` async
context manager that yields a connection with ``fetchval(sql)``. We hand
the factory a :class:`_FakePool` that implements exactly those two
methods — no socket, no Postgres, no testcontainers needed. Integration
coverage (real pool, real Postgres) lives in the TASK-021b/c integration
suites where the auth and route wiring matters end-to-end.

Why we don't use :mod:`unittest.mock` for the pool: a hand-rolled fake
makes the failure-mode tests (``raise on acquire``, ``return -1 from
fetchval``) easy to read at the call site without setting up
``side_effect`` chains. The fake is ~30 lines and reads as a contract.
