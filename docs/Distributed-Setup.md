# Distributed Setup — VPS A control-plane, laptops B/C workers (M1)

> **Status:** Released in **v4.4** (M1 of the Whilly Distributed v5.0 mission).
> **Pairs with:** `docker-compose.control-plane.yml`, `docker-compose.worker.yml`,
> `whilly worker connect <url>`. The single-host workshop demo
> (`docker-compose.demo.yml` + `workshop-demo.sh`) is unchanged and continues
> to work identically — see [`DEMO.md`](../DEMO.md). M1 is purely additive.

This doc is a copy-paste-ready walkthrough for the **two-host** (or N-host)
deployment shape that lands in v4.4: one VPS runs the control-plane, two or
more laptops join as workers, and the operator watches the audit log fan out
across multiple `worker_id`s.

The end-state demo:

```
       +----------------------------+              +----------------------------+
       |  Host A: VPS (e.g. Hetzner)|  HTTP(S)     |  Host B: macbook /         |

                                       claim
```

For the design of the future per-worker editing workspace (M4), see the
companion document [`docs/Workspace-Topology.md`](Workspace-Topology.md). M1
intentionally does **not** implement that workspace; M1 only ships the
deployment artifacts that make a multi-host control-plane possible.

## Prerequisites

| Host | Required | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| VPS A | Docker 24+, Docker Compose v2 (the dash-separated `docker-compose` binary is fine), 1 GB RAM, 2 GB free disk, ports 80/443/8000 free, public IPv4 | Runs Postgres (256 MB) + control-plane (256 MB) under the M1 mission's 600 MB budget |
| Laptop B/C | Python 3.12+ with `whilly-orchestrator` installed (see below), or Docker for the worker container path, network reachability to VPS A on port 8000 (or 443 behind Caddy at M2) | Runs `whilly worker connect <url>` or `docker-compose -f docker-compose.worker.yml up` |

> **Default agent: opencode + Big Pickle (zero-key, free).** Since
> v4.4.2 (`m1-opencode-big-pickle-default`), worker containers ship
> with `WHILLY_CLI=opencode` and `WHILLY_MODEL=opencode/big-pickle` —
> OpenCode Zen's free, anonymous "stealth" model (no API key, no
> `opencode auth login`, no env var setup required as of 2026-05-02).
> A fresh checkout + `bash workshop-demo.sh` works out of the box.
> During Big Pickle's free period collected prompts may be used to
> improve the model — see
> [https://opencode.ai/docs/zen/](https://opencode.ai/docs/zen/).
>
> **Escape hatches** (set BOTH the `WHILLY_MODEL` and the matching key
> in `.env`, gitignored — never commit a real key):
> - **Groq gpt-oss-120b** (free tier, ~14k req/day) —
>   `WHILLY_MODEL=groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b` plus `GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...`
>   from [https://console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com). The
>   worker re-engages a fail-fast single-line diagnostic if the key is
>   missing while `WHILLY_MODEL=groq/...`.
> - **Anthropic Claude Opus 4.6** —
>   `WHILLY_MODEL=anthropic/claude-opus-4-6` plus `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...`.
> - **OpenAI gpt-4o-mini** —
>   `WHILLY_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini` plus `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`.

Two install closures cover the worker side. Pick whichever fits the host:

```bash
# Python install (no Docker on the laptop required)
pip install 'whilly-orchestrator[worker]'

# Docker install (uses the same image as the control-plane)
docker pull mshegolev/whilly:4.4.0
```

> **TIP:** the worker install closure is intentionally narrow — it does
> NOT pull `fastapi` or `asyncpg`. The `.importlinter` `core-purity`
> contract enforces this on every release; a worker laptop never needs the
> server-side dependency tree.

## Two-host via localhost.run

> **Status: Available since v4.5.** Tailscale was removed from the
> architecture in the 2026-05-02 pivot. The replacement is a small
> **`funnel` sidecar** (`m2-localhostrun-funnel-sidecar`) that holds an
> outbound SSH reverse tunnel to **localhost.run** (free anonymous
> tier — no account, no SSH key) and publishes the assigned
> `https://<random>.lhr.life` URL into:
>
> 1. The Postgres `funnel_url` singleton table (primary; created by
>    migration 010).
> 2. The shared-volume file `/funnel/url.txt` (fallback for workers
>    without postgres reachability).
>
> The sidecar reconnects with exponential backoff on disconnect and
> re-publishes the freshly-assigned URL — operators do not need to
> intervene on URL rotation.

This section walks through the **two host topologies** the sidecar
enables. Both are documented end-to-end so operators can pick the
shape that matches their hardware. For the per-environment-variable
reference, the tier-decision matrix (anonymous vs SSH-key), and the
admin-CLI walkthrough, see [`docs/Deploy-M2.md`](Deploy-M2.md).

### Quick context

The `funnel` service is added to **both** new compose files as a
profile-gated entry — default `docker compose ... up` is byte-equivalent
to v4.4 (the sidecar does NOT start without `--profile funnel`). It
ships as a separate ~32 MB Alpine image (`Dockerfile.funnel`) carrying
only `openssh-client + bash + curl + postgresql-client`.

| Service | Compose file | Activated by |
|---|---|---|
| `funnel` | `docker-compose.demo.yml` | `docker compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml --profile funnel up -d` |
| `funnel` | `docker-compose.control-plane.yml` | `docker compose -f docker-compose.control-plane.yml --profile funnel up -d` |

**Free-tier rotation caveat.** The anonymous tier rotates the public
URL "after a few hours" of session lifetime (per the localhost.run
FAQ). The sidecar absorbs every reconnect transparently — but workers
that hard-code the URL (no `WHILLY_FUNNEL_URL_SOURCE=postgres|file`
re-discovery) need to be restarted manually after a rotation. For a
**stable URL** (free localhost.run account + dedicated SSH key,
deferred to M3 in this mission), see [`docs/Deploy-M2.md`
§ "localhost.run tier — staging vs prod"](Deploy-M2.md#localhostrun-tier--staging-vs-prod).

### Scenario A — Laptop-host control-plane (most common)

The control-plane and the sidecar both run on **your laptop**; workers
connect from a VPS, a teammate's laptop, or a phone-tethered
colleague. Useful for hands-on demos and short working sessions.

```bash
# 1. Bring up the control-plane + funnel sidecar on the laptop.
cd /opt/develop/whilly-orchestrator
export WHILLY_WORKER_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"

docker compose -f docker-compose.control-plane.yml \
    --profile funnel \
    up -d

# 2. Wait for the sidecar to parse its lhr.life URL (~10s).
docker compose -f docker-compose.control-plane.yml logs funnel \
    | grep -oE 'https://[a-z0-9-]+\.lhr\.life' \
    | head -n1
```

Workers anywhere on the public internet (no VPN, no custom CA) join
via the published URL. Two equally-valid worker-side strategies:

**Strategy A.1 — Postgres re-discovery (preferred for long-lived workers).**
Worker reads the URL from the `funnel_url` table and re-registers
idempotently when the URL rotates.

```bash
# On the worker host (e.g. VPS).
export WHILLY_DATABASE_URL="$WHILLY_DATABASE_URL"  # set in your .env (see config/settings.py)
export WHILLY_FUNNEL_URL_SOURCE=postgres

whilly worker connect "$(psql -t -A "$WHILLY_DATABASE_URL" \
    -c 'SELECT url FROM funnel_url ORDER BY updated_at DESC LIMIT 1')" \
    --bootstrap-token "$WHILLY_WORKER_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN" \
    --plan demo \
    --hostname "$(hostname)"
```

> The worker-side polling loop that watches `funnel_url` for
> rotation lives in feature `m2-worker-url-refresh-on-rotation` —
> see the contract in [`docs/Deploy-M2.md`
> § "Worker-side URL re-discovery"](Deploy-M2.md#worker-side-url-re-discovery).

**Strategy A.2 — One-shot static URL (simplest).**
Worker takes a snapshot of the URL once and uses it as a plain
`WHILLY_CONTROL_URL`. If localhost.run rotates the URL, restart the
worker by hand.

```bash
URL=$(psql -t -A "$WHILLY_DATABASE_URL" \
    -c 'SELECT url FROM funnel_url ORDER BY updated_at DESC LIMIT 1')

whilly worker connect "$URL" \
    --bootstrap-token "$WHILLY_WORKER_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN" \
    --plan demo \
    --hostname "$(hostname)"
```

In either strategy the worker does **not** need `--insecure` —
localhost.run terminates a real Let's Encrypt cert at the edge so
the URL-scheme guard accepts the HTTPS URL without complaint.

### Scenario B — VPS-host control-plane

The control-plane and the sidecar run on a **public VPS**; workers
connect from laptops. Less common because a VPS usually has its own
public IP and can serve `WHILLY_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0` directly — but
this scenario is **fully supported** for two cases:

* The VPS sits behind NAT (no inbound public port, only outbound TCP/22).
* The operator wants the worker side to use the same URL-discovery
  contract regardless of where the control-plane lives (single
  worker codepath for cross-environment automation).

```bash
# On the VPS.
export VPS_HOST=vps.example.com
ssh root@$VPS_HOST
cd /root/whilly
export WHILLY_WORKER_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"

docker compose -f docker-compose.control-plane.yml \
    --profile funnel \
    up -d

docker compose -f docker-compose.control-plane.yml logs funnel \
    | grep -oE 'https://[a-z0-9-]+\.lhr\.life' \
    | head -n1
```

Workers on laptops connect via the same flows as Scenario A.1 / A.2
above (the strategies are URL-discovery-mode choices, independent of
whether the control-plane is on a laptop or a VPS).

### Verifying the published URL

Either source-of-truth works for spot checks:

```bash
# Postgres (primary publisher target).
psql "$WHILLY_DATABASE_URL" \
    -c 'SELECT id, url, updated_at FROM funnel_url ORDER BY updated_at DESC LIMIT 1;'

# Shared-volume file (fallback publisher target).
docker compose -f docker-compose.control-plane.yml exec funnel \
    cat /funnel/url.txt
```

Both are bumped on every reconnect. The sidecar logs the regex match
once per session (`[funnel ...] discovered URL: https://...lhr.life`)
so `docker compose logs funnel` is the simplest way to spot the
latest URL without writing SQL.

### Source-IP forensics: out of scope under localhost.run

localhost.run terminates TLS at the `lhr.life` edge and reverse-tunnels
the cleartext request over SSH back to the `funnel` sidecar. Both the
sidecar and the control-plane therefore only ever observe the **funnel
container's IP** as the request peer — the original external client IP
is **not** preserved on the wire. As a consequence, `events.payload->>'source_ip'`
is intentionally **not populated** on `WORKER_REGISTERED` /
`/api/v1/admin/*` audit events under the M2 deploy path; treat the
field as absent rather than null-but-meaningful, and do not rely on it
as an impostor-detection signal in token-rotation runbooks. A future
paid-tier deploy path (e.g. localhost.run dedicated tunnel surfacing
`X-Forwarded-For`, or a Caddy reverse-proxy in front of the
control-plane) would revisit this assertion and start populating
`source_ip` from the proxy header.

---

## VPS A — control-plane

Everything below runs as root on the VPS. The default config keeps the
API on `127.0.0.1` (loopback only), which is the LAN-safe default for
private deployments. The two most common public-facing options
(`WHILLY_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0` for plain HTTP, or the M2 localhost.run
`funnel` sidecar for HTTPS) are both one env var away.

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
export VPS_HOST=vps.example.com
ssh root@$VPS_HOST
cd /root
git clone https://github.com/mshegolev/whilly-orchestrator.git whilly
cd whilly
git checkout v4.4.0
```

### 2. Create a per-cluster bootstrap secret

```bash
mkdir -p /root/whilly/secrets
openssl rand -hex 32 > /root/whilly/secrets/bootstrap.token
chmod 600 /root/whilly/secrets/bootstrap.token
export WHILLY_WORKER_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN="$(cat /root/whilly/secrets/bootstrap.token)"
```

The bootstrap token is the cluster-join secret. It only authenticates
`POST /workers/register`; per-worker bearers are minted server-side and
stored in each worker's OS keychain. The token can be rotated at any
time without invalidating already-registered workers (per FR-1.2 split,
see [`whilly/adapters/transport/auth.py`](../whilly/adapters/transport/auth.py)).

### 3. Pick a bind interface

```bash
# Default (loopback only — safe for Tailscale / VPN).
unset WHILLY_BIND_HOST

# Expose on all IPv4 interfaces (e.g. plain HTTP + LAN demo, or before
# Caddy is in front).
export WHILLY_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0

# IPv6 dual-stack (Linux: ``[::]:8000`` listener).
export WHILLY_BIND_HOST=::

# Bind only to a specific LAN IP.
export WHILLY_BIND_HOST=10.0.0.5
```

Compose validates the value at port-mapping parse time — an invalid host
fails fast with stderr identifying the bind error, rather than silently
falling back to the wildcard.

### 4. Bring the control-plane up

```bash
# Modern Docker Compose v2 (recommended — `docker compose` with a space):
docker compose -f docker-compose.control-plane.yml up -d
docker compose -f docker-compose.control-plane.yml ps
docker compose -f docker-compose.control-plane.yml logs -f control-plane

# Legacy v1 ``docker-compose`` (dash) binary still works identically:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.control-plane.yml up -d
docker-compose -f docker-compose.control-plane.yml ps
docker-compose -f docker-compose.control-plane.yml logs -f control-plane
```

> **Note on the binary name.** Compose v2 ships as a `docker` subcommand
> (`docker compose ...`, with a space). The standalone `docker-compose`
> (dash form, v1) is end-of-life upstream but still works on hosts that
> retained it. The compose files themselves are byte-equivalent for
> both invocations — pick whichever your VPS image already has.

Within ~60 s both `postgres` and `control-plane` should be `running`,
with `postgres` reaching `healthy`. From the VPS itself:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
# {"status":"ok"}
```

If you set `WHILLY_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0`, a `curl` from your laptop should
also succeed:

```bash
export VPS_HOST=vps.example.com
curl -fsS http://$VPS_HOST:8000/health
```

### 5. Import a plan

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.control-plane.yml exec control-plane \
    whilly plan import examples/demo/tasks.json
docker-compose -f docker-compose.control-plane.yml exec control-plane \
    whilly plan show demo
```

The control-plane is multi-tenant per `plan_id`; you can import as many
plans as you like and steer each worker at a specific one with
`--plan <id>`.

---

## Laptop B / C — workers

This is the one-line bootstrap that distinguishes v4.4 from v4.3.1. Each
laptop registers, persists its per-worker bearer in the OS keychain, and
becomes a long-running worker process.

### Option 1 — Native install (`whilly worker connect`)

```bash
export VPS_HOST=vps.example.com
pip install 'whilly-orchestrator[worker]'

whilly worker connect http://$VPS_HOST:8000 \
    --bootstrap-token "$WHILLY_WORKER_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN" \
    --plan demo \
    --hostname "$(hostname)" \
    --insecure   # dev-only: opts out of the loopback-only HTTP guard
```

> ⚠️ `--insecure` here is a **dev-only loopback-bypass**: the
> `whilly-worker` URL-scheme guard otherwise rejects plain HTTP to a
> non-loopback host (see the warning blockquote below for the full
> details and the recommended HTTPS path that lands in **M2**).

Stdout shows two `key: value` lines (line-oriented and pipeable):

```
worker_id: w-XXXXXXXX
token: <plaintext bearer>
```

After printing those, the process `execvp`s into `whilly-worker` —
foreground PID 1 of the operator's shell becomes the worker loop. The
bearer is also written to the OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Linux
Secret Service, Windows Credential Manager) under
`service="whilly", user=<canonical control URL>`. On a headless Linux
host (no D-Bus), the bearer is written to `~/.config/whilly/credentials.json`
at mode `0600` instead.

> **Plain HTTP to a non-loopback host** is rejected up front with
> `--insecure` advice in stderr. Pass `--insecure` (as shown in the
> snippet above) to acknowledge the risk if you really must use
> plaintext over the LAN — this is a **dev-only loopback-bypass**.
> HTTPS is the recommended production path; once **M2** lands the
> localhost.run `funnel` sidecar, drop `--insecure` and point the
> worker at the rotating `https://<random>.lhr.life` URL instead.
> See
> [`--insecure` semantics: trust-store vs hostname verification](#--insecure-semantics-trust-store-vs-hostname-verification)
> below for the precise scope of what `--insecure` does and does
> **not** disable on HTTPS targets.

If the OS keychain is unavailable and the fallback file write also
fails, the bearer is still printed to stdout — capture it manually and
pass it to `whilly-worker --token <bearer>` later.

### Option 2 — Docker (`docker-compose.worker.yml`)

If the laptop has Docker but no Python, the worker can run as a
container.

```bash
cp .env.worker.example .env.worker
$EDITOR .env.worker        # set WHILLY_CONTROL_URL, WHILLY_WORKER_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN

docker-compose -f docker-compose.worker.yml --env-file .env.worker up -d
docker-compose -f docker-compose.worker.yml --env-file .env.worker logs worker
```

> **Container name:** `docker-compose.worker.yml` does NOT pin
> `container_name:`, so Compose auto-generates names like
> `whilly-orchestrator-worker-1`. Use `docker-compose ... logs worker`
> (service name) or `docker logs $(docker-compose -f
> docker-compose.worker.yml ps -q worker | head -1)` instead of the
> legacy `docker logs whilly-worker`. The worker registers itself with
> the container's `$(hostname)` (see `WHILLY_WORKER_HOSTNAME` in
> `.env.worker`), so the audit-log identity stays meaningful regardless
> of the generated container name.

#### Multi-worker scenario (`--scale worker=N`)

For load-test or memory-pressure scenarios (VAL-M2-DEMO-902,
VAL-M2-LHR-003) you can spin up multiple workers from the same compose
file by passing `--scale worker=N`:

```bash
# Bring up 3 workers against an already-running control-plane.
docker-compose -f docker-compose.worker.yml --env-file .env.worker up -d \
    --scale worker=3 --no-build

# Confirm 3 distinct container names (whilly-orchestrator-worker-1..3)
# and 3 worker_ids in the control-plane audit log.
docker ps --filter name=worker --format '{{.Names}}'
```

All workers share the same `WHILLY_CONTROL_URL` and bootstrap token
from `.env.worker`. They register independently — each picks up a
unique `worker_id` from the control-plane and reports its own
`$(hostname)` (Compose assigns each replica a distinct hostname by
default). To simulate distinct hosts more realistically, leave
`WHILLY_WORKER_HOSTNAME` unset in `.env.worker` so each replica falls
back to the auto-generated container hostname.

The container's entrypoint runs the legacy bash-awk register flow by
default (`WHILLY_USE_CONNECT_FLOW` unset / `0`). To exercise the new
`whilly worker connect` path inside the container, set
`WHILLY_USE_CONNECT_FLOW=1` in `.env.worker` — the entrypoint then
delegates URL validation, registration, keychain persistence, and exec
to the same Python codepath that `pip`-installed laptops use.

```env
# .env.worker
WHILLY_USE_CONNECT_FLOW=1
WHILLY_CONTROL_URL=http://vps.example.com:8000
WHILLY_WORKER_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN=<paste cluster bootstrap token here>
WHILLY_PLAN_ID=demo
```

> **Truthiness rules.** The entrypoint accepts `1`, `true`, `yes`,
> `on` (case-insensitive) as truthy. Empty / unset / `0` / `false` /
> `no` / `off` are falsy and keep the legacy path. Mirrors what the
> rest of the entrypoint already does for `WHILLY_INSECURE`.

### `--insecure` semantics: trust-store vs hostname verification

`--insecure` disables **only** trust-store / CA-chain validation on
the worker's HTTPS client: an issuer the OS does not trust (e.g. a
self-signed cert minted by the operator on a known host) stops being
a fatal error. It does **not** weaken hostname verification — `httpx`
continues to enforce SNI and SAN matching against the configured
host, so a cert issued for `evil.com` served at `<our-host>` is
rejected with a TLS hostname-mismatch error even when `--insecure`
is set. The flag exists so operators can run with self-signed certs
on a known host (cert SAN matches the URL host); it does **not**
permit accepting any random cert at any host.

---

## Verifying the cluster

Once both laptops are connected, you should see two distinct
`worker_id`s in the audit log on the VPS:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.control-plane.yml exec postgres \
    psql -U whilly -d whilly -c \
    "SELECT DISTINCT worker_id FROM events
     WHERE event_type='CLAIM' AND plan_id='demo';"
```

A 5-task `demo` plan should drain across both workers within a couple
of minutes (depending on the agentic CLI / stub binary in use). Final
state should show all 5 tasks `DONE` and at least two distinct
`worker_id`s contributing `COMPLETE` events:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.control-plane.yml exec postgres \
    psql -U whilly -d whilly -c \
    "SELECT status, count(*) FROM tasks
     WHERE plan_id='demo'
     GROUP BY status;"
```

---

## Operating the cluster

### Disconnect / reconnect a worker

`Ctrl-C` on the laptop's foreground process triggers a graceful
release: the worker emits a `RELEASE` event for its current claim and
exits. The control-plane's offline-worker sweep picks up the released
claim within ≤150 s and re-offers it to other workers.

### Re-running connect

Re-running `whilly worker connect` against the same control-plane URL
mints a *new* `worker_id` row server-side and overwrites the keychain
entry locally — the old bearer no longer authenticates. The keychain
key is the canonical control URL (trailing slashes stripped) so two
runs against `http://vps:8000/` and `http://vps:8000` resolve to the
same entry.

### Memory budget

On the 964 MB-RAM VPS profile, expect:

| Service | Cap | Typical RSS |
|---|---|---|
| postgres | 256 MB | 80–120 MB |
| control-plane | 256 MB | 60–100 MB |
| (Caddy at M2) | 64 MB | 30–50 MB |

Validate with `docker stats --no-stream` after the demo run.

---

## Backwards compatibility

v4.4 is strictly additive. Specifically:

* `docker-compose.demo.yml` is byte-for-byte unchanged from v4.3.1.
* `mshegolev/whilly:4.3.1` continues to pass `bash workshop-demo.sh --cli claude`.
* `docker/entrypoint.sh` defaults to the legacy bash-awk register path;
  the new `whilly worker connect` codepath is only taken when
  `WHILLY_USE_CONNECT_FLOW` is truthy.
* All v3-era CLI flags continue to dispatch correctly. `whilly --tasks tasks.json`,
  `whilly --headless`, `whilly --resume`, `whilly --reset` all still work.

If anything in your existing single-host workflow regresses against
v4.4, that is a bug — please open an issue.

## Reference: env vars added in v4.4

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `WHILLY_BIND_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Host interface the control-plane's port 8000 is mapped to. Set to `0.0.0.0` (IPv4 wildcard), `::` (IPv6 wildcard), or any explicit interface IP to expose the API beyond loopback. |
| `WHILLY_USE_CONNECT_FLOW` | unset (legacy) | When truthy (`1`, `true`, `yes`, `on`), the worker container's entrypoint uses `whilly worker connect` instead of the legacy bash-awk register flow. Default OFF preserves byte-equivalent v4.3.1 stderr/stdout. |
| `WHILLY_WORKER_HOSTNAME` | `whilly-worker` | Hostname the worker self-reports during register. Surfaces in the `workers` table and event payloads — set this to something humans can grep (`macbook-mvs`, `vps-eu-1`). |

---

## Reference: Dockerfile build-args (image build-time)

The `Dockerfile` in this repo exposes a build-arg on **both** image
targets that controls which agent CLIs are pre-installed in the image.
This is a fallback / size-optimization escape hatch for constrained
build environments (e.g. a Colima VM with limited disk) — default
builds preserve zero functional regression.

| Build-arg | Stage | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `WHILLY_AGENT_CLIS` | `runtime` (multi-role image, `mshegolev/whilly:<version>`) | `@anthropic-ai/claude-code @google/gemini-cli opencode-ai @openai/codex` | Space-separated list of npm packages to install with `npm install -g`. |
| `WHILLY_AGENT_CLIS` | `worker` (worker-only image) | `opencode-ai` | Same — but the worker stage's default reflects v4.4's opencode-by-default policy (m1-opencode-groq-default). |

### Examples

```bash
# Slim worker image with only opencode (== current default; explicit form):
docker buildx build --target worker \
    --build-arg WHILLY_AGENT_CLIS='opencode-ai' \

## Audit reports

The mission's distributed-systems audit reports live at the canonical
mirror [`library/distributed-audit/`](../library/distributed-audit/),
which is byte-equal to the working copy under
`.planning/distributed-audit/` and the legacy `docs/distributed-audit/`
mirror retained for backwards-compatibility:

* `current-state.md` — what v4.3.1 already does for distributed deploys.
* `gap-analysis.md` — what's missing and why M1/M2/M3 close those gaps.
* `extension-surfaces.md` — concrete extension points in the codebase.
* `research-findings.md` — referenced upstream patterns / RFCs / SDKs.
* `readiness-deps.md` — package-readiness check results.
* `readiness-validation.md` — surface-readiness check results.

The mirror is regenerated idempotently via
[`scripts/m1_baseline_fixtures.py`](../scripts/m1_baseline_fixtures.py); a
re-run on a clean checkout is a no-op.
