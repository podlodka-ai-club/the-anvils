"""``whilly-worker`` console script — remote-worker entry point (TASK-022c, PRD FR-1.5, TC-6).

Composition root for the *remote* worker: this is the symmetric counterpart
to :mod:`whilly.cli.run` (which composes the *local* worker).

* :mod:`whilly.cli.run` opens an asyncpg pool, registers the worker via
  ``INSERT INTO workers``, instantiates a :class:`TaskRepository`, and
  drives :func:`whilly.worker.run_worker`.
* :mod:`whilly.cli.worker` (this module) opens an
  :class:`~whilly.adapters.transport.client.RemoteWorkerClient` over HTTP,
  assumes the worker row already exists on the control plane (registered
  out-of-band via the bootstrap-token flow — TASK-022a2), and drives
  :func:`whilly.worker.run_remote_worker_with_heartbeat`.

The two adapters never share a process: a *local* worker is colocated with
Postgres and would never need the HTTP transport, while a *remote* worker
runs on a different VM and intentionally has no asyncpg / FastAPI import
path (PRD SC-6 — see ``.importlinter`` contract). This split is the whole
point of the v4.0 refactor — see ``docs/Whilly-v4-Architecture.md``.

Why a separate console script ``whilly-worker``?
------------------------------------------------
The ``whilly`` console script (``whilly.cli:main``) bundles the legacy v3
parser, the ``plan`` subcommand, and ``whilly run``. All three pull in
asyncpg either eagerly or via the lazy-import seam. A standalone
``whilly-worker`` console script means a remote worker box only needs the
worker-flavour dependency closure (httpx + pydantic + ``whilly.core`` +
``whilly.adapters.transport.client``) — installing ``whilly-orchestrator``
on a worker VM but never running ``whilly`` works because Python imports
are pay-as-you-go. Wiring this through the ``whilly`` dispatcher would
nominally work too, but the AC for TASK-022c reads ``Entry point
зарегистрирован в pyproject.toml`` (singular) and operators expect the
binary name to match the worker's role rather than guess at a subcommand.

Required CLI flags / env vars
-----------------------------
============================  ==========================  =============================================
Flag                          Env var                     Meaning
============================  ==========================  =============================================
``--connect <url>``           ``WHILLY_CONTROL_URL``      Control-plane base URL (incl. scheme + port).
``--token <bearer>``          ``WHILLY_WORKER_TOKEN``     Per-worker bearer token (PRD FR-1.2, NFR-3).
``--plan <id>``               ``WHILLY_PLAN_ID``          Plan id this worker draws claims from.
============================  ==========================  =============================================

Optional flags
--------------
* ``--worker-id <id>`` — override the auto-generated identity (env:
  ``WHILLY_WORKER_ID``); defaults to ``<hostname>-<8-hex>`` so two workers
  on the same host don't collide. Same precedence chain as
  :mod:`whilly.cli.run`.
* ``--once`` — process exactly one task (whose terminal status is
  successfully written via ``client.complete`` or ``client.fail``) and
  exit 0. Wires through :func:`run_remote_worker_with_heartbeat`'s
  ``max_processed=1``. Idle polls and 409 lost-races do not count
  (intentional — see ``max_processed`` docstring on the loop).
* ``--heartbeat-interval <seconds>`` — override the 30s default
  (:data:`whilly.worker.remote.DEFAULT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL`). Mostly a
  test hook so an integration loop ticks observably.
* ``--max-iterations <n>`` — outer-loop cap. Test hook for CI runs that
  want a deterministic exit; production leaves it unset.

Why ``--token`` is the per-worker bearer, not the bootstrap secret
------------------------------------------------------------------
The bootstrap secret only authenticates ``POST /workers/register``. Once
the register call returns ``(worker_id, per_worker_token)``, every other
RPC must use the per-worker token (PRD FR-1.2 split, see
:mod:`whilly.adapters.transport.auth`). A ``whilly-worker`` instance
expects to *claim* tasks immediately — it has no reason to register first
unless an operator explicitly chose to pair these flows. Keeping
``--token`` bound to the per-worker bearer matches the steady-state RPC
surface (claim/complete/fail/heartbeat/release) and avoids the ambiguity
that would come with a single ``--token`` flag swapping meanings based on
the presence of ``--register``. A future ``whilly-worker register``
subcommand can land separately if operators want a bundled bootstrap.

Exit codes
----------
Mirrors :mod:`whilly.cli.run` so the v4 worker surface is consistent:

* ``0`` — worker loop returned normally (``--once`` completed one task,
  ``--max-iterations`` reached, or a SIGTERM/SIGINT-flipped ``stop``
  unwound the TaskGroup cleanly).
* ``2`` — *environment failure*: ``--connect`` / ``--token`` / ``--plan``
  missing, or argparse rejected the invocation. The AC reads "Отсутствие
  токена → exit 2 с подсказкой" — the diagnostic always names the env
  var so a fresh user can fix it without reading the source.

We do not map runtime exceptions onto exit codes here. A
:class:`~whilly.adapters.transport.client.AuthError` from the loop means
the operator gave us a wrong / rotated token — that's a configuration
error too, but it surfaces as an asyncio traceback because the
supervisor (Kubernetes, systemd) is what should react: log loudly,
restart, and let the env propagate the new token. Swallowing the
exception into ``return 2`` would conflate "you forgot the env" with
"your env is wrong" and make operator triage harder.

Why no ``--bootstrap-token`` flag here
--------------------------------------
The composition root is intentionally bare: register + token-rotation
flows are a separate concern owned by a future ``whilly-worker register``
subcommand. Mixing them here would tempt callers to share one token for
both purposes, which would defeat the FR-1.2 split (rotate the bootstrap
secret without invalidating per-worker bearers). When the register flow
lands, it will be a sibling subcommand (``whilly-worker register
--bootstrap-token X``) that prints the per-worker token + worker_id and
exits — the operator then re-invokes ``whilly-worker`` with those
values.

Synthetic Plan, no DB read
--------------------------
The remote worker only needs ``plan.id`` (passed to
:meth:`RemoteWorkerClient.claim`) and ``plan.name`` (rendered into the
agent prompt by :func:`whilly.core.prompts.build_task_prompt`). The
*tasks* are owned by the server and arrive via ``claim`` one at a time;
there is no benefit to fetching the full task list locally and the
worker has no SQL access by design. We therefore build a synthetic
:class:`whilly.core.models.Plan` with ``name = id`` (operators rarely
need the human-readable name in the worker journal, and a wire-level
``GET /plans/{id}`` doesn't exist today). If the prompt cosmetics
matter, ``--plan-name`` could be added later — punted from TASK-022c.

    The register flow is intentionally separate from the
    :func:`build_worker_parser` loop parser:

    * **Different auth.** ``register`` carries the cluster-join secret
      (``WHILLY_WORKER_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN``), the worker loop carries the
      per-worker bearer token. Sharing one ``--token`` flag would
      conflate them.
    * **Different lifecycle.** ``register`` is a one-shot RPC that
      prints the plaintext token and exits 0; the worker loop runs
      indefinitely. A single argparse parser would drag the worker-
      loop knobs (``--once``, ``--heartbeat-interval``, ...) into
      ``register --help`` for no reason.

    Output contract
    ---------------
    On success the command writes two lines to stdout, one ``key:
    value`` per line, terminated by newlines:

    .. code-block:: text

       worker_id: w-<urlsafe-suffix>
       token: <opaque-bearer>

    register | grep '^token:' | cut -d' ' -f2``) and matches the
    VAL-AUTH-040 evidence assertion ("TUI snapshot shows non-empty
    ``token: ...`` line"). Operators in interactive TTYs can copy-
    paste either field directly.

    Why no JSON output?
        JSON would force operators to install ``jq`` to peel off one
        field for the next command (``whilly worker --token=...``).
        The ``key: value`` shape is shell-native and the CLI is meant
        for human + ad-hoc-script consumption — a future ``--json``
        flag can land if a tool requires structured output.

    Default since v4.4.2 (feature m1-opencode-big-pickle-default): the

    ``WHILLY_MODEL`` therefore no longer routes through Groq, so the

    The check is intentionally narrow:

    * ``WHILLY_CLI`` must be exactly ``opencode`` (case-insensitive,
      whitespace-stripped). Any other CLI selector (or empty/unset)
      returns ``None`` because GROQ_API_KEY is not their concern.
    * ``WHILLY_MODEL`` must start with the literal ``groq/`` prefix —
      i.e. the operator explicitly opted into Groq. Empty value (the
      v4.4.2 default → big-pickle) and any other provider
      (``anthropic/claude-...``, ``openai/gpt-4o``, …) bypass the check.
    * ``GROQ_API_KEY`` is empty / whitespace-only / unset.

    Forward-compatibility safety net for the v4.4.2 zero-key default
    (misc-m1-big-pickle-sunset-watch). When OpenCode Zen flips
    ``opencode/big-pickle`` from "free, anonymous" to "requires API
    key", every fresh worker that ships with the v4.4.2 default will
    silently fail at the FIRST agent run with an unhelpful provider
    401. This helper detects the flip at worker startup and emits a
    clear multi-line warning naming the three documented escape
    hatches with copy-paste-ready ``WHILLY_MODEL=...`` lines.

    Behaviour
    ---------
    * Gated behind ``WHILLY_BIG_PICKLE_HEALTHCHECK`` (must equal the
      literal string ``"1"`` after stripping whitespace; any other
      value leaves the helper inactive). Default OFF — operators who
      don't care don't pay the ~10s probe cost on every worker boot.
    * When active, runs ``opencode run --format json --model
      opencode/big-pickle 'ping'`` with a 10-second wall-clock timeout
      under :func:`subprocess.run`.
    * Healthy probe (return code 0, no auth-failure markers in
      stdout/stderr) → returns ``None``.
    * Auth-failure probe (any of ``401`` / ``403`` / ``"API key
      required"`` / ``"unauthorized"`` markers in stdout or stderr) →
      returns the multi-line warning string (caller writes it to
      stderr; the worker DOES NOT exit).
    * Probe execution failure (``opencode`` not on ``PATH``,
      subprocess timeout, any other ``OSError``) → returns ``None``.
      The helper is a safety net, not a hard gate; falsely warning a
      user whose laptop happens to be offline would be worse than the
      occasional missed sunset alert (the weekly CI workflow at
      ``.github/workflows/big-pickle-health.yml`` is the actual
      early-warning system).

    Why a separate helper, not folded into ``check_opencode_groq_credentials``?
        The groq guard is a *config* check — it inspects ``os.environ``
        only, runs in microseconds, and is unconditionally invoked at
        the top of ``run_connect_command``. This helper performs a
        ~seconds-scale subprocess probe and MUST stay opt-in; sharing
        a function would force operators who don't care about Big
        Pickle to either disable it explicitly or eat the latency.

    Returns ``EXIT_OK`` only if ``os.execvp`` is reached; in production
    ``execvp`` replaces the process and never returns, but the value
    still matters for unit tests that monkeypatch ``execvp``.

    Worker-runtime arg pass-through (``--`` sentinel)
    -------------------------------------------------
    ``connect`` itself only understands the connect-CLI args (URL,
    ``--bootstrap-token`` / ``--plan`` / ``--hostname`` / ``--insecure`` /
    ``--no-keychain`` / ``--keychain-service``). Worker-runtime flags
    (``--once``, ``--worker-id``, ``--heartbeat-interval``,
    ``--max-iterations``) belong to the *exec'd* ``whilly-worker``
    binary, not to argparse here. To plumb them through cleanly we treat
    a literal ``--`` token as a sentinel: everything before goes to this
    parser, everything after is appended verbatim to the ``whilly-worker``
    argv right after the connect-supplied ``--connect`` / ``--token`` /
    ``--plan`` triplet (and the optional ``--insecure``).

    This matches the standard POSIX convention (``cmd ARGS -- TARGET-ARGS``)
    and keeps the entrypoint contract honest: the docker
    ``entrypoint.sh worker --once`` invocation lands on the worker loop,
    not on the connect parser.

    Error envelope:

    * ``EXIT_CONNECT_ERROR`` (1) — bootstrap missing/empty, URL invalid,
      scheme guard rejected, register 401, control-plane unreachable,
      ``whilly-worker`` not on PATH after a successful register, or any
      other runtime failure of the connect flow.
    * ``EXIT_ENVIRONMENT_ERROR`` (2) — argparse rejected the invocation
      (e.g. missing positional). Argparse handles this directly via
      ``SystemExit(2)`` when ``parse_args`` fails.
