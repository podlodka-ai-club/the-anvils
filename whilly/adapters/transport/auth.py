"""FastAPI bearer-auth dependencies for the worker ↔ control-plane HTTP API.

This module owns the *edge* of authentication: the FastAPI ``Depends``
callables that every worker-facing route hangs off. It deliberately stays
small and side-effect-free so the route layer in
:mod:`whilly.adapters.transport.server` (TASK-021a3) can compose auth
without ever touching the env directly.

Two surfaces, two env vars
--------------------------
=========================  ============================  =========================================
Dependency                 Env var                       Used by
=========================  ============================  =========================================
:func:`bearer_auth`        ``WHILLY_WORKER_TOKEN``       claim / complete / fail / heartbeat (TASK-021b/c)
:func:`bootstrap_auth`     ``WHILLY_WORKER_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN``  ``POST /workers/register`` (TASK-021b)
=========================  ============================  =========================================

The split is intentional: a shared bootstrap secret is what lets a fresh
worker box join the cluster (it has no credentials of its own yet), while
the per-worker bearer token is what every steady-state RPC carries. Keeping
them in separate env vars means an operator can rotate the bootstrap secret
(e.g. after a compromise of the deploy artefact) without invalidating every
already-running worker's bearer — and vice versa.

Why ``secrets.compare_digest`` instead of ``==``
-------------------------------------------------
Plain string equality short-circuits on the first mismatched byte. An
attacker who can time the response can probe the token byte-by-byte to
recover it. :func:`secrets.compare_digest` runs in constant time over the
longer of the two inputs — the extra cycles are free relative to the HTTP
round-trip and the timing leak is closed off by construction. This matters
even for a "shared static token": treating bearer comparison as carefully as
password comparison is the cheap, obviously-correct default.

Why dependencies are factory functions, not module-level callables
------------------------------------------------------------------
``bearer_auth`` / ``bootstrap_auth`` could be plain functions that read the
env on every request. Instead they're returned by factories
(:func:`make_bearer_auth` / :func:`make_bootstrap_auth`) that read the env
*once* at app construction. Three reasons:

1. **Test isolation.** Tests can build a dependency bound to a specific
   token without mutating ``os.environ`` (and racing with other tests).
2. **Fast-fail at startup.** A missing token raises during
   :func:`whilly.adapters.transport.server.create_app` (TASK-021a3), not on
   the first 401 in production — config errors surface before traffic.
3. **No silent fallback.** Reading on every request invites
   "if env was set, accept; if not, accept all" patterns. A factory binds
   the value once and the fast path stops worrying about reconfiguration.

The module also re-exports module-level :data:`bearer_auth` /
:data:`bootstrap_auth` shims that lazy-initialise from the env on first use.
These are convenient for routes that haven't been wired through
:func:`create_app` yet (early prototyping, ad-hoc scripts), but production
code should always go through :func:`make_bearer_auth` /
:func:`make_bootstrap_auth` so the missing-env error surfaces at startup.

Why 401 (not 403)
-----------------
RFC 7235 / RFC 6750 §3: a missing or invalid bearer is a 401 with
``WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="whilly"``. 403 means "I know who you are,
you can't do this" — but we don't know who they are if the token is wrong.
FastAPI's :class:`HTTPException` doesn't set the header by default, so the
helper :func:`_bearer_401` builds it explicitly.

    This is the v4.1 successor to :func:`make_bearer_auth` for the
    steady-state RPC surface (claim / complete / fail / heartbeat /
    release). The dep:

    1. Extracts the bearer token from ``Authorization: Bearer <…>``
       (same RFC 6750 / RFC 7235 handling as
       :func:`make_bearer_auth` — missing header / wrong scheme /
       empty token all surface as 401 with
       ``WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="whilly"``).
    2. Hashes the presented plaintext via :func:`hash_bearer_token`
       and asks the repository to resolve it to a ``worker_id``
       (``SELECT worker_id FROM workers WHERE token_hash = $1`` —
       see :meth:`whilly.adapters.db.TaskRepository.get_worker_id_by_token_hash`).
       A hit returns 200; a miss falls through to step 3.
    3. **Optional legacy fallback.** If ``legacy_token`` is set
       (operator opted into the v4.0 shared-bearer behaviour by
       leaving ``WHILLY_WORKER_TOKEN`` defined), the dep
       :func:`secrets.compare_digest`-checks the presented bearer
       against ``legacy_token``. On match it accepts the request AND
       emits the one-shot deprecation warning via
       :func:`_maybe_warn_legacy_worker_token`. Per-worker bearer
       precedence is preserved by *order of evaluation*: the DB
       lookup runs first, so a registered worker's bearer that
       happens to also equal ``legacy_token`` (vanishingly unlikely)
       still authenticates as the per-worker identity and does not
       trigger the deprecation log (VAL-AUTH-034).
    4. On all other paths — miss in the DB, no legacy token, or
       legacy token set but doesn't match — raise 401 ``invalid
       token`` (same wire shape as the v4.0 closure factory so the
       remote-worker error mapper doesn't have to learn a new
       discriminator).

    Why a *factory* rather than a module-level dep?
        Same rationale as :func:`make_bearer_auth`: the closure
        captures ``repo`` and ``legacy_token`` once at app build
        time, so a mid-process env mutation can't drift the auth
        surface. The repo handle stays bound across the whole
        FastAPI request lifecycle without each request having to
        reach into ``request.app.state``.

    Why no DB call on the legacy path when the lookup misses?
        Two SQL round-trips per failed auth would amplify a
        password-spray DoS. Hashing is constant-time anyway; the
        ``compare_digest`` against ``legacy_token`` runs in fixed
        time over the longer of the two strings, no information leak
        about whether the token was "close" to a real one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repo:
        :class:`TaskRepository` bound to the app's asyncpg pool.
        Captured by the closure. The repo's
        :meth:`get_worker_id_by_token_hash` is the only method the
        dep calls — keeps the auth surface narrow and easy to fake
        in tests.
    legacy_token:
        Optional plaintext shared-bearer kept for one-minor-version
        backwards compatibility (PRD AC: "shared-bearer fallback
        через env var оставить на одну минорную версию"). When
        ``None``, the dep is purely DB-backed and any non-matching
        bearer returns 401 — the v4.2 future shape. When set, a
        successful match logs the one-shot deprecation warning
        (suppressible via :data:`SUPPRESS_WORKER_TOKEN_WARNING_ENV`).

    Identity binding (TASK-101 scrutiny round-1 fix)
    ------------------------------------------------
    On a successful per-worker hash hit the dep stashes the resolved
    ``worker_id`` on ``request.state.authenticated_worker_id`` so the
    route handler's :func:`whilly.adapters.transport.server._require_token_owner`
    check can reject cross-worker calls (worker A's bearer used to act
    as worker B) with a 403 — VAL-AUTH-024. On the legacy
    ``WHILLY_WORKER_TOKEN`` fallback path, ``authenticated_worker_id`` is
    set to ``None`` (identity unknown — the shared cluster token cannot
    name a specific worker), and the route-level helper treats that as
    a no-op so the one-minor-version legacy compat window
    (VAL-AUTH-030/031/034) stays green. A dep raise (401) does not
    write to ``request.state`` — Starlette unwinds the request before
    a handler runs, so unauthenticated requests never observe a
    half-set state.

    Returns
    -------
    IdentityBindingAuthDependency
        An async callable suitable for ``Depends(...)`` that takes a
        :class:`fastapi.Request` and the ``Authorization`` header.
        Returns ``None`` on success (matching the
        :func:`make_bearer_auth` shape so handlers can continue to
        declare it as ``dependencies=[Depends(bearer_dep)]`` without
        consuming a return value); side-effect is the

    """Build a per-operator bootstrap ``Depends`` callable backed by ``bootstrap_tokens``.

    M2 mission: replaces the single shared
    ``WHILLY_WORKER_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`` env var with per-operator rows
    minted via ``whilly admin bootstrap mint`` (migration 009).
    Behaves like :func:`make_db_bearer_auth` for the bootstrap surface
    (``POST /workers/register``):

    1. Extract the bearer per RFC 6750 / RFC 7235.
    2. Hash the plaintext via :func:`hash_bootstrap_token` (same SHA-256
       digest the repo's mint path uses) and ask
       :meth:`TaskRepository.get_bootstrap_token_owner` to resolve it.
       A hit returns ``(owner_email, is_admin)`` — both stashed on
       ``request.state.bootstrap_owner_email`` /
       ``request.state.bootstrap_is_admin`` so the route handler
       (``register_worker``) can attribute the new ``workers`` row to
       the operator who minted the token.
    3. **Optional legacy fallback.** If ``legacy_token`` is set
       (operator left ``WHILLY_WORKER_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`` defined for
       one-minor-version backwards compatibility), the dep
       :func:`secrets.compare_digest`-checks the presented bearer
       against ``legacy_token``. On match the dep accepts the request
       AND emits a one-shot deprecation warning via
       :func:`_maybe_warn_legacy_bootstrap_token`. On the legacy path
       ``request.state.bootstrap_owner_email`` is set to ``None`` and
       ``bootstrap_is_admin`` to ``False`` — the shared token cannot
       identify a specific operator and is never admin-scoped.
    4. Otherwise raise 401 ``invalid bootstrap token``.

    Why a separate factory rather than retrofitting
    :func:`make_bootstrap_auth`?
        Symmetry with the per-worker pair (``make_bearer_auth`` vs.
        ``make_db_bearer_auth``): the static-token form is preserved
        for tests and ad-hoc scripts that don't need the DB; the
        DB-backed form is the primary surface for ``create_app``.
        Re-using one entry point with both shapes would have to
        sniff arg types (string vs. repo), which obscures intent at
        the call site.

    Why no DB call on the legacy hit?
        Two SQL round-trips per failed auth would amplify a
        password-spray DoS, and the legacy fallback is itself a
        constant-time comparison against an in-process string —
        symmetric with :func:`make_db_bearer_auth`'s behaviour.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repo:
        :class:`TaskRepository` bound to the app's asyncpg pool.
        Captured by the closure. Only
        :meth:`get_bootstrap_token_owner` is called from this dep.
    legacy_token:
        Optional plaintext shared bootstrap secret kept for one
        minor version (PRD AC: "shared-bearer fallback через env
        var оставить на одну минорную версию"). When ``None``, the
        dep is purely DB-backed and any non-matching bearer
        returns 401.

    Returns
    -------
    IdentityBindingAuthDependency
        Async ``Depends`` callable taking ``Request`` + the
        ``Authorization`` header. Returns ``None`` on success;
        side-effect is the ``request.state`` writes documented above.

    """Build a FastAPI ``Depends`` that gates ``/api/v1/admin/*`` routes on an admin bootstrap token.

    M2 mission: ``whilly admin bootstrap mint --is-admin`` mints a
    bootstrap-token row with ``is_admin=true`` (migration 009). This
    factory wraps the same DB-backed lookup as
    :func:`make_db_bootstrap_auth` but tightens the verdict:

    * 401 on missing / malformed / wrong bearer (no DB lookup
      performed when the header is absent / non-Bearer / empty);
    * 403 on a known active *non-admin* bootstrap token (auth
      succeeded but the operator is not admin-scoped);
    * 200 (i.e. dep returns ``None``) on a known active admin
      bootstrap token; ``request.state.bootstrap_owner_email`` /
      ``bootstrap_is_admin=True`` are stashed for downstream
      handlers / audit log emission.

    Legacy ``WHILLY_WORKER_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`` env-var fallback is
    intentionally NOT admin-scoped: the shared cluster bootstrap
    secret cannot identify an operator and therefore cannot be
    elevated. A request bearing the legacy token against an admin
    route returns 403 (auth succeeded as a non-admin operator). One-
    shot deprecation warning still fires on the legacy hit so the
    operator notices.

    Why 403 (not 401) for non-admin?
        RFC 7235 / RFC 6750 §3 : 401 is "I don't know who you are";
        403 is "I know you, you can't do this". A known-active token
        is authenticated; admin-scope is the *authorisation* gate.
        This split lets operator dashboards separate "wrong token"
        from "right token, wrong scope" cleanly. VAL-M2-ADMIN-AUTH-008
        / -902 pin this contract.

    Why no DB-existence leak through the response code?
        Per VAL-M2-ADMIN-AUTH-904: a revoked-but-formerly-admin
        token, an active non-admin token, and a fully-bogus token
        each yield well-defined codes that don't disclose existence
        beyond what the active-set lookup already discloses
        (revoked / expired / unknown all collapse to 401; active
        non-admin yields 403). The DB lookup runs only after the
        bearer header parse passes (VAL-M2-ADMIN-AUTH-010).
