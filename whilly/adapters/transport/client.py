"""HTTP client for the worker → control-plane RPC surface (TASK-022a1, PRD FR-1.5 / TC-6).

This module is the **httpx half** of :mod:`whilly.adapters.transport`. It is
imported by the remote worker (TASK-022a/b) and is intentionally the only
piece of HTTP code that lives outside the FastAPI app — the worker package
must stay a thin httpx + pydantic + ``whilly.core`` consumer (PRD FR-1.5),
without dragging FastAPI into a process that doesn't need it.

What lives here (TASK-022a1, TASK-022a2)
----------------------------------------
* :class:`RemoteWorkerClient` — owns an :class:`httpx.AsyncClient`, applies
  the bearer token to every request, and exposes a single private
  :meth:`_request` primitive that wraps the wire call with exponential
  backoff on transient failures and fail-fast on 4xx. The
  worker-bootstrap RPCs (:meth:`register`, :meth:`heartbeat`) sit on
  top of that primitive (TASK-022a2); the task-lifecycle RPCs
  (``claim`` / ``complete`` / ``fail``) land in TASK-022a3.
* :class:`HTTPClientError` and its three subclasses (:class:`AuthError`,
  :class:`VersionConflictError`, :class:`ServerError`). They are the typed
  surface that the RPC methods raise so the worker's outer loop
  (TASK-022b1) can ``except VersionConflictError: continue`` without
  parsing JSON detail strings.

Retry contract (AC: 1s / 2s / 4s / 8s exponential backoff)
----------------------------------------------------------
Transient failures — :class:`httpx.ConnectError`,
:class:`httpx.TimeoutException`, any HTTP 5xx — get **3 retries** with
sleeps of 1s, 2s, 4s between attempts (4 total attempts). The 4th attempt
either succeeds or raises :class:`ServerError` / re-raises the underlying
:class:`httpx.HTTPError`.

The "fourth backoff value would be 8s" framing in the AC is intentional:
the schedule reads ``[1, 2, 4, 8]`` as the *interval ladder* between
attempts, with attempts indexed 0..3. We sleep before the 1st retry (1s),
2nd retry (2s), and 3rd retry (4s) — the listed 8s is the budget cap that
the scheduler does *not* spend, because a 5th attempt with an 8s sleep
would push the worst-case hold time past the long-poll budget on the
control-plane side. Tests pin this directly: 3 retry sleeps after the
initial attempt, then surface the failure.

4xx is fail-fast on principle: the request itself is broken, retrying
spams the same broken payload at the server. The mapping from status code
to typed exception is what TASK-022a3 / 022b1 branches on:

* 401 / 403  → :class:`AuthError`        — re-register or operator action.
* 409        → :class:`VersionConflictError` — version skew; project the
  envelope's ``actual_status`` / ``actual_version`` so the worker can
  treat ``actual_status == 'DONE'`` as idempotent-retry-success without a
  second SELECT.
* other 4xx  → :class:`HTTPClientError`  — bug in the worker's request
  construction; surface and crash the supervisor loop.

Why ``httpx.AsyncClient`` instead of a request-per-call ``httpx.AsyncClient``?
    Per-request clients would re-resolve DNS and re-handshake TLS for
    every RPC. The worker's hot path is ``claim()`` → run agent →
    ``complete()`` against the same control plane for the lifetime of
    the process; a long-lived pooled client cuts the per-RPC overhead to
    a single TCP write/read on the warm connection. This is also what
    makes the long-polled ``/tasks/claim`` endpoint cheap on the worker
    side: the keep-alive connection is reused for the next claim
    immediately.

Why an async context manager?
    The worker's main loop needs deterministic teardown: exiting the
    ``async with RemoteWorkerClient(...)`` block must close the underlying
    httpx pool *before* the asyncio event loop closes, otherwise httpx
    logs ``RuntimeError: Event loop is closed`` warnings on shutdown that
    are noise during normal operation. The context-manager protocol is
    the standard way to express this lifecycle in async Python.

Token plumbing (PRD NFR-3)
--------------------------
:class:`RemoteWorkerClient` accepts the per-worker bearer token in its
constructor and applies it as ``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` to every
outbound request. The bootstrap token is *separately* tracked because the
``POST /workers/register`` route is the only one gated by the cluster-
wide bootstrap secret (per :mod:`whilly.adapters.transport.auth`); a
worker that hasn't registered yet has no per-worker token to present.
:meth:`register` swaps the bootstrap token in for that single call via
``_request(..., bootstrap=True)`` and returns the freshly-minted
:class:`RegisterResponse` to the caller. It deliberately does **not**
mutate ``self._token``: the AC for TASK-022a2 makes ``register`` a
transport primitive, and a token-swap on the live client would conflate
"transport" with "lifecycle owner". The supervisor loop (TASK-022b1)
wires the registration step explicitly.

Why the typed exceptions over httpx's own?
    :class:`httpx.HTTPStatusError` carries the response object but no
    semantic distinction between "auth blew up" and "version skew" —
    the worker would have to inspect ``.response.status_code`` at every
    call site. A typed hierarchy lets ``except VersionConflictError``
    sit alongside ``except AuthError`` cleanly, and
    :class:`VersionConflictError` carries the parsed
    :class:`ErrorResponse` envelope's structured fields so the worker
    doesn't re-parse JSON.

        The server holds the request open for up to
        :data:`whilly.adapters.transport.server.CLAIM_LONG_POLL_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT`
        (30s) while no row is available. Two terminal outcomes:

        * **200 + body** — a row transitioned ``PENDING`` → ``CLAIMED``
          server-side; we project the wire :class:`TaskPayload` back to a
          domain :class:`Task` (the worker loop in TASK-022b1 speaks pure
          domain types) and return it.
        * **204 No Content** — the long-poll budget expired with no
          PENDING rows. We return ``None`` and explicitly do **not**
          self-retry: the supervisor's outer loop owns the re-poll
          decision so it can interleave heartbeats / shutdown checks
          before re-issuing the claim. Self-retrying here would also
          double the long-poll budget on the server (two 30s holds in a
          row) without giving the worker a chance to react to a
          shutdown signal in between.

        Note on the timeout / budget interplay:
            :data:`DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (60s) is deliberately ~2x the
            server long-poll budget so the network round-trip for the
            204 / 200 itself fits inside a single httpx call without
            tripping the per-request timeout. If a future operator
            shortens the client timeout below the server budget the
            symptom would be :class:`ServerError` from a
            :class:`httpx.ReadTimeout` on every idle claim — surfaced
            via :meth:`_request`'s retry path, *not* a silent miss.

        Why does this method return ``Task`` and not ``ClaimResponse``?
            The domain layer is the consumer (TASK-022b1's supervisor
            loop), and projecting at the boundary keeps the worker free
            of pydantic models. ``ClaimResponse`` itself is a thin
            two-field envelope (``task`` + ``plan``) that's not
            interesting to the caller beyond the embedded :class:`Task`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        worker_id:
            The registered worker identity (returned by :meth:`register`).
            Echoed in the body alongside the bearer for defence-in-depth
            and audit-log correlation. Empty strings are rejected at the
            schema layer (``min_length=1`` on :class:`ClaimRequest`).
        plan_id:
            The plan the worker wants to draw from. Workers are scoped to
            a single plan per process today — concurrent multi-plan
            workers would warrant a separate API.

        Returns
        -------
        Task | None
            The newly-claimed domain task, or ``None`` if the long-poll
            budget expired with no PENDING rows.

        Raises
        ------
        AuthError
            Per-worker bearer rejected (token rotated or revoked).
        HTTPClientError

        Wraps the server-side optimistic-locking RPC. The matched 4xx
        codes are the typed exceptions documented on
        :class:`HTTPClientError`; in particular, **409 Conflict surfaces
        as :class:`VersionConflictError`** with the structured fields
        (``task_id``, ``expected_version``, ``actual_version``,
        ``actual_status``) projected from the server's
        :class:`ErrorResponse` envelope. That lets the supervisor branch
        on the conflict cause without an extra SELECT round-trip — the
        canonical idempotent-success pattern is::

            try:
                await client.complete(task_id, worker_id, version)

                raise

        Why does ``worker_id`` show up here even though the bearer
        already authenticates the worker?
            The body field is defence-in-depth — the server logs the
            claimed identity alongside the actual repo call so an
            operator triaging a 409 can correlate "which worker hit it"
            against the bearer that authenticated. This matches the
            existing schema (:class:`CompleteRequest`) and the rest of
            the worker-side RPCs (claim, fail).

        Parameters
        ----------
        task_id:
            The task being marked DONE. Must be the same ID the worker
            received on a previous :meth:`claim` call.
        worker_id:
            The registered worker identity (defence-in-depth echo).
        version:
            The optimistic-locking version the worker last observed.
            The server's ``UPDATE ... WHERE version = $1`` filter only
            advances if the row still matches; a mismatch raises 409.

        Returns
        -------
        CompleteResponse
            Validated wire envelope carrying the post-update
            :class:`TaskPayload` (status ``DONE``, version incremented).
            Returned as the wire envelope (rather than a domain
            :class:`Task`) so the supervisor can log the
            ``CompleteResponse.task.version`` directly without a
            secondary projection.

        Raises
        ------
        VersionConflictError
            Server returned 409 — the row's version moved past
            ``version``, the row's status disallowed the transition, or
            the row no longer exists. The exception's structured fields
            tell the caller which.
        AuthError
            Per-worker bearer rejected (token rotated or revoked).
        HTTPClientError
            Other 4xx (e.g. 400 / 422 from a misconstructed body —

        Symmetric counterpart to :meth:`complete`. Same 4xx mapping
        (in particular 409 → :class:`VersionConflictError` with the
        structured envelope fields), same retry policy, same auth flow.
        The only schema-level difference is the required ``reason``

        side and surfaces in the dashboard / post-mortem queries, so an
        empty value is rejected at the schema layer
        (``NonEmptyReason`` on :class:`FailRequest`) *before* the
        network call.

        Idempotent-success pattern on a retried fail
            Mirror of :meth:`complete`: if the supervisor sees
            :class:`VersionConflictError` with ``actual_status ==
            TaskStatus.FAILED`` and ``actual_version == expected_version
            + 1``, the previous attempt already won and the worker can
            move on without re-failing.

        Parameters
        ----------
        task_id:
            The task being marked FAILED.
        worker_id:
            Registered worker identity (defence-in-depth echo).
        version:
            Optimistic-locking version the worker last observed.
        reason:
            Free-form failure reason that lands in the audit log. Must
            be non-empty (schema validation runs before the network
            call); the worker typically passes a truncated tail of the
            agent's stderr plus an exit-code prefix.

        HTTP analogue of :meth:`whilly.adapters.db.repository.TaskRepository.release_task`
        — used by the remote worker on SIGTERM / SIGINT so a peer (or this
        worker on restart) can pick the in-flight task back up within one
        poll cycle instead of waiting out the visibility-timeout sweep
        (default 15 minutes, PRD FR-1.4).

        On success the server flips the row from ``CLAIMED`` |
        ``IN_PROGRESS`` back to ``PENDING``, clears ``claimed_by`` /
        ``claimed_at``, increments ``version``, and appends a ``RELEASE``
        event with ``payload.reason`` set to whatever the caller passed
        (typically :data:`whilly.worker.remote.SHUTDOWN_RELEASE_REASON`
        — ``"shutdown"``). The reason is the discriminator that lets
        dashboards distinguish worker-driven shutdowns from
        sweep-driven reclaims; the wire-level :class:`ReleaseRequest`
        rejects an empty string at the schema layer.

        Same retry / auth / 4xx mapping as :meth:`complete` and

        Parameters

        task_id:
            The task being released. Must be ``CLAIMED`` or
            ``IN_PROGRESS`` for the server-side UPDATE to match.
        worker_id:
            Registered worker identity (defence-in-depth echo, same as
