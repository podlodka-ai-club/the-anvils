"""FastAPI app factory for the worker ↔ control-plane HTTP API (TASK-021a3 / TASK-021b / TASK-021c1 / TASK-021c2, PRD FR-1.1 / FR-1.2 / FR-1.3 / FR-1.6 / TC-6).

This module is the *composition root* of the control-plane HTTP surface.
:func:`create_app` wires the asyncpg pool, the auth dependencies from
:mod:`whilly.adapters.transport.auth` and the wire schemas from
:mod:`whilly.adapters.transport.schemas` into a single FastAPI app. The
task-facing terminal endpoints (``/tasks/{id}/complete``,
``/tasks/{id}/fail``) live alongside ``/tasks/claim`` so route handlers
stay co-located with the lifespan / state / auth plumbing they depend on.

What lives here today (TASK-021a3 + TASK-021b + TASK-021c1 + TASK-021c2)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* :func:`create_app(pool, *, worker_token, bootstrap_token)` — factory.
  Stores ``pool``, a :class:`TaskRepository` and the two pre-bound auth
  dependencies on ``app.state`` so handlers added in TASK-021c can reach
  them via ``request.app.state``. Tokens default to the values from the
  environment so production callers can ``create_app(pool)`` with no
  kwargs and still get a fail-fast error if the env is misconfigured.
  Tests pass tokens explicitly to avoid touching ``os.environ``.
* ``GET /health`` — unauthenticated liveness/readiness probe. Pings the
  pool with ``SELECT 1`` and returns ``{"status": "ok"}`` on success, 503
  with ``{"status": "unavailable", "detail": ...}`` on database failure.
  A bare 200 would lie when the Postgres link has died; the round-trip
  cost is one already-warmed connection (see
  :func:`whilly.adapters.db.create_pool`) and the operational win — early
  detection by Kubernetes liveness or an external uptime probe — is
  large.
* ``POST /workers/register`` — cluster-join RPC (PRD FR-1.1). Gated by
  the bootstrap-token dependency: a fresh worker has no per-worker
  credentials yet, so the only secret it can prove possession of is the
  cluster-wide bootstrap token. Server mints a fresh ``worker_id`` +
  per-worker bearer token, hashes the token via SHA-256, and inserts the
  ``workers`` row through :meth:`TaskRepository.register_worker`. The
  *plaintext* token is returned exactly once in the response — the
  server discards it after sending. PRD NFR-3 guarantees plaintext is
  never persisted server-side.
* ``POST /workers/{worker_id}/heartbeat`` — liveness ping (PRD FR-1.6).
  Gated by the per-worker bearer dependency — the cluster's shared
  ``WHILLY_WORKER_TOKEN`` proves the caller is a registered member.
  Calls :meth:`TaskRepository.update_heartbeat` and surfaces the bool
  return as ``{"ok": ...}``. A 200 with ``ok=false`` (worker no longer
  registered) is the documented recoverable state — the caller should
  re-register and resume rather than crashing.
* ``POST /tasks/claim`` — long-polled task acquisition (PRD FR-1.3).
  Gated by the per-worker bearer dependency. Wraps
  :meth:`TaskRepository.claim_task` in a *server-side* poll loop: the
  request is held open for up to ``claim_long_poll_timeout`` seconds
  (default 30s), with the repo polled every ``claim_poll_interval``
  seconds (default 1.5s) until either a row transitions PENDING →
  CLAIMED or the deadline expires. A successful claim returns 200 with
  :class:`ClaimResponse` carrying the post-claim :class:`TaskPayload`;
  the timeout returns 204 No Content (per AC). 204 (rather than 200
  with a null task) keeps the wire small on the timeout path and lets
  the remote worker (TASK-022b1) re-poll without redundant JSON
  decoding. ``plan`` is intentionally left ``None`` here — the AC scope
  is "Task | 204"; populating it is deferred to a future task that
  needs the prompt context server-side.
* ``POST /tasks/{task_id}/complete`` — terminal-state RPC (PRD FR-1.1
  / FR-2.4). Gated by the per-worker bearer dependency. Thin wrapper
  over :meth:`TaskRepository.complete_task`: the worker sends the
  ``version`` it last observed (from the claim response or its own
  heartbeat) and the server's UPDATE filter (``WHERE id = $1 AND
  version = $2 AND status = 'IN_PROGRESS'``) provides the optimistic
  lock. Success returns 200 + :class:`CompleteResponse` carrying the
  post-update :class:`TaskPayload` (status ``DONE``, version + 1).
  :class:`whilly.adapters.db.VersionConflictError` maps to 409 + an
  :class:`ErrorResponse` envelope carrying the full conflict tuple
  (``task_id``, ``expected_version``, ``actual_version``,
  ``actual_status``) — the remote worker (TASK-022a3 / 022b1) reads
  those fields directly to decide retry vs drop vs surface, instead
  of running its own follow-up SELECT. The 409 body shape is a
  contract: any change here must land in lock-step with TASK-022a3's
  client-side error mapper.
* ``POST /tasks/{task_id}/fail`` — symmetric terminal-state RPC.
  Same shape as ``complete`` but accepts a non-empty ``reason`` in the
  body — the value flows straight into ``events.payload`` so the
  dashboard (TASK-027) and post-mortem queries can surface a human-
  readable cause without re-scanning logs. Same 409 contract on
  conflict. ``fail_task``'s SQL accepts both ``CLAIMED`` and
  ``IN_PROGRESS`` source states (a worker can crash before
  :meth:`TaskRepository.start_task` has even fired) — the route
  surfaces this faithfully without filtering further.
* OpenAPI docs at ``/docs`` (Swagger UI) and the spec at
  ``/openapi.json`` — both wired by FastAPI's defaults; we don't move
  them off the default paths because operators expect them there.

Long-polling design (PRD FR-1.3)
--------------------------------
The repository call (:meth:`TaskRepository.claim_task`) is itself fast —
a single SQL round-trip with ``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED``. The long-poll
budget exists because issuing the same query on a tight loop would
slam Postgres for an empty plan; sleeping ``claim_poll_interval``
between attempts caps the wasted query rate at ~67 qps per idle
worker (well under what the database can absorb) without sacrificing
latency on the warm path. ``asyncio.sleep`` is cancellation-friendly:
if the HTTP client disconnects mid-poll, Starlette propagates
:class:`asyncio.CancelledError` through the sleep and the handler
unwinds cleanly without occupying a pool connection any longer than
the in-flight ``claim_task`` round-trip itself.

Deadline-based (``time.monotonic()``) rather than count-based
(``range(int(timeout / interval))``) because :func:`asyncio.sleep` may
overshoot the requested duration under event-loop pressure; the
deadline guarantees the total wall-clock time never exceeds the
budget. We do one final ``claim_task`` *without* sleeping when the
loop falls through, so a task that lands in the very last interval
window is still picked up before we return 204.

Token hashing (PRD NFR-3)
-------------------------
Per-worker tokens are produced by :func:`secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` —
~256 bits of entropy. Plain SHA-256 is correct here: with that much
entropy there is no dictionary to attack, so the slow-hashing argument
that motivates bcrypt for *passwords* doesn't apply. Constant-time hash
verification is also the natural fit for the bearer-auth path — the
heavy work-factor of bcrypt on every request would amplify trivially-
abusable DoS vectors. We keep the hash format opaque (raw lowercase
hex) so a future migration to argon2 / a salted scheme can land in
:func:`_hash_token` without touching the routes.

Why a factory, not a module-level ``app``
-----------------------------------------
A module-level ``app = FastAPI()`` would force the pool / tokens to be
read from globals (env, module state) at import time. That breaks:

* **Tests.** Pytest can't construct multiple apps with different tokens
  or fake pools without monkey-patching the import.
* **The CLI run command (TASK-024 / TASK-025a).** The supervisor wants
  to open the pool, hand it to the app, and tear them down in a defined
  order; if the app opened the pool itself we'd have two lifecycles to
  reconcile.
* **Mid-flight reconfiguration.** A factory makes it explicit that
  rebuilding the app is the way to change config — no surprising
  late-binding of ``app.state.pool``.

This mirrors :func:`whilly.cli.run.run_run_command`'s composition shape
exactly: open pool → build object that needs pool → run → close pool.

Pool ownership
--------------
:func:`create_app` does **not** open or close the pool. Callers pass an
already-opened :class:`asyncpg.Pool` and are responsible for closing it
when the app shuts down (typically via
:func:`whilly.adapters.db.close_pool` in their own supervisor scope).
This is symmetric with the local-worker entry point in TASK-019c —
keeping pool ownership in the caller means we never accidentally
double-close on hot reloads or in tests that share a pool across
requests.

HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT_SECONDS: Final[int] = 2 * 60

#: Default cadence (seconds) for the offline-worker sweep itself
#: (TASK-025b). 30s is the PRD's reference cadence — half the heartbeat
#: interval (workers tick at ~30s; see TASK-019b1 / TASK-022b2), so a

#: seconds of going stale. Tests override this to ~0.1s so the suite
#: stays fast.

    and writes one ``RELEASE`` event per row with ``payload['reason'] =
    'visibility_timeout'`` (audit drift impossible — see the SQL in

    Why an :class:`asyncio.Event` instead of cancellation?
        Mirrors :func:`whilly.worker.main.run_heartbeat_loop` /
        :func:`whilly.worker.main.run_worker`: lifespan teardown sets
        ``stop`` and the loop drops out of its current

        :class:`asyncio.CancelledError`. This means the enclosing
        :class:`asyncio.TaskGroup` exits without an exception group at
        all on the happy shutdown path — fewer corner cases for the
        FastAPI lifespan to catch and re-surface.

    Why catch ``Exception`` per tick?
        A transient asyncpg disconnect, a Postgres pgbouncer restart, or
        a (pathological) FK violation on the audit insert must not kill
        the sweep. The sweep is the *only* mechanism that recovers
        claims orphaned by a hard-killed worker (PRD SC-2 fault
        tolerance); silently turning it off because of one bad SQL
        round-trip would defeat its whole purpose. We log via

    Why a second loop instead of folding both sweeps into one?
        The two sweeps observe different signals on different timing
        budgets (see :meth:`TaskRepository.release_offline_workers`'s
        docstring). Coupling them into a single coroutine would force
        the slower ``visibility_timeout`` cadence on the offline sweep
        and make SC-2's fast-recovery target hard to reach without
        also tightening the visibility timeout (which risks spuriously
        cancelling live work). Two coroutines on independent intervals
        keep the policies decoupled. The shared :class:`asyncio.TaskGroup`
        and :class:`asyncio.Event` keep the supervision boundary single.

    Why the same ``stop`` event as the visibility sweep?
        Lifespan teardown is "stop *all* background work" — splitting
        the event would force the lifespan to set both with no behaviour
        difference. One event is simpler and there's no scenario where
        we'd want to stop one sweep without the other.

    ``Exception`` is caught per tick for the same reason as the
    visibility sweep: a transient asyncpg disconnect / pgbouncer restart
    must not silently disable the only mechanism that recovers tasks
    from a hard-killed worker. We log via ``logger.exception`` and try
    again on the next interval. ``BaseException`` propagates.

    """Build a FastAPI control-plane app bound to ``pool`` and the configured tokens.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pool:
        Already-opened asyncpg pool. ``create_app`` does not own its
        lifecycle — the caller closes it.
    worker_token:
        Per-worker bearer token (PRD FR-1.2). If ``None``, read from
        :data:`whilly.adapters.transport.auth.WORKER_TOKEN_ENV` (i.e.
        ``WHILLY_WORKER_TOKEN``). Tests pass an explicit value to avoid
        env mutation.
    bootstrap_token:
        Cluster-join secret for ``POST /workers/register``. If ``None``,
        read from
        :data:`whilly.adapters.transport.auth.BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN_ENV`
        (i.e. ``WHILLY_WORKER_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN``).
    claim_long_poll_timeout:
        Total seconds the ``POST /tasks/claim`` handler holds the
        request open while polling for a PENDING task. Defaults to
        :data:`CLAIM_LONG_POLL_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT` (30s — the PRD budget).
        Tests pass a small value (e.g. 0.3s) so the suite isn't
        dominated by the long-poll wait time.
    claim_poll_interval:
        Seconds between ``claim_task`` retries inside the long-poll
        loop. Defaults to :data:`CLAIM_POLL_INTERVAL_DEFAULT` (1.5s).
        Must be strictly positive — a zero / negative interval would
        spin a tight loop against Postgres and is rejected.
    visibility_timeout_seconds:
        Age threshold for the periodic stale-claim sweep (PRD FR-1.4,
        TASK-025a). A ``CLAIMED`` / ``IN_PROGRESS`` row whose
        ``claimed_at`` predates ``NOW() - this`` is flipped back to
        ``PENDING`` by the next sweep tick. Defaults to
        :data:`VISIBILITY_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT_SECONDS` (15 minutes — the
        PRD's reference value). Tests override this with a small value
        (e.g. ``1``) so they can age out a CLAIMED row in milliseconds.
        Must be ``>= 0``; ``0`` releases every active claim on every
        tick (only useful in tests with fully-controlled clocks).
    sweep_interval_seconds:
        Cadence of the visibility-timeout sweep loop (PRD FR-1.4,
        TASK-025a). Defaults to :data:`SWEEP_INTERVAL_DEFAULT_SECONDS`
        (60s — the PRD's reference cadence). Must be strictly positive
        — a zero or negative interval would tight-loop the database
        and defeat :func:`asyncio.wait_for` as a cancellation point.
    heartbeat_timeout_seconds:
        Heartbeat-staleness threshold for the offline-worker sweep
        (PRD FR-1.4 / NFR-1 / SC-2, TASK-025b). A worker whose
        ``last_heartbeat`` predates ``NOW() - this`` and is still
        ``status = 'online'`` is flipped to ``offline`` by the next
        sweep tick, and all its CLAIMED / IN_PROGRESS tasks are
        released. Defaults to
        :data:`HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT_SECONDS` (2 min — well under
        the visibility timeout, so the heartbeat sweep is the primary
        fault-tolerance signal). Must be ``>= 0``; ``0`` flips every
        online worker on every tick (only useful in tests).
    offline_worker_sweep_interval_seconds:
        Cadence of the offline-worker sweep loop (TASK-025b). Defaults
        to :data:`OFFLINE_WORKER_SWEEP_INTERVAL_DEFAULT_SECONDS` (30s
        — half the heartbeat interval, so a missed heartbeat is
        detected within at most ``threshold + interval`` seconds).
        Must be strictly positive for the same reason as
        ``sweep_interval_seconds``.

    Returns
    -------
    FastAPI
        Configured app with ``/health``, ``/docs``, ``/openapi.json``,
        ``/workers/*`` and ``POST /tasks/claim`` wired. TASK-021c2 adds
        ``POST /tasks/{id}/complete`` and ``POST /tasks/{id}/fail`` onto
        this same app instance.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If a required token is missing both from kwargs and the
        environment. The error names the env var so operators don't
        have to grep the codebase to find what's missing.

        Cancellation
            ``asyncio.sleep`` is cancellation-friendly: if the client
            disconnects mid-poll, Starlette propagates
            :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` through the sleep and the

            longer than the in-flight ``claim_task`` round-trip itself.

        Why one final attempt past the deadline?
            ``asyncio.sleep`` overshoots under event-loop pressure;
            using a deadline-based loop guarantees the wall-clock
            budget but means the *last* sleep can put us past the
            deadline before we've actually polled. We do one
            unconditional final ``claim_task`` so a row that arrived

            :class:`VersionConflictError` carries ``task_id``,
            ``expected_version``, ``actual_version``, and
            ``actual_status``. We project them into the
            :class:`ErrorResponse` envelope so a remote worker
            (TASK-022a3) can branch on the actual conflict cause
            without an extra SELECT round-trip:

            * ``actual_status is None`` and ``actual_version is None`` →
              the row is gone (FK cascade in tests, mis-routed worker);
            * ``actual_version != expected_version`` → another writer
              advanced the counter first (lost-update / re-claim);
            * ``actual_version == expected_version`` and ``actual_status``
              is ``DONE`` / ``FAILED`` / ``SKIPPED`` → idempotent retry,
              the worker can treat it as success and move on.

            The error code string is ``"version_conflict"`` — a stable
            machine-readable identifier the client maps onto its own
            retry policy, mirrored in TASK-022a3's mapper.

        Why a JSONResponse for 409 instead of HTTPException?
            ``HTTPException(detail=...)`` only fills the ``detail``
            field of FastAPI's default error envelope; it cannot
            populate the structured fields (``task_id``,
            ``expected_version``, etc.) that :class:`ErrorResponse`
            promises. Returning a typed :class:`JSONResponse` lets us
            ship the full envelope while still honouring the
            ``responses`` map declared on the route, so /docs shows
            the correct shape on the conflict path.

        HTTP analogue of :meth:`TaskRepository.release_task` — wraps the
        same SQL primitive the local worker calls directly on
        SIGTERM / SIGINT (TASK-019b2). Mirrors :func:`fail_task`'s
        shape because the request bodies are identical (worker_id +
        version + non-empty reason); the only differences are the
        terminal status (``PENDING`` rather than ``FAILED``) and the
        event_type (``RELEASE`` rather than ``FAIL``).

        Why a dedicated endpoint rather than reusing /fail with a
        special reason?
            ``fail_task`` flips the row to ``FAILED``, which would
            require the visibility-timeout sweep to re-PENDING it
            *and* would surface in the dashboard's "failed task"
            counter for what is actually a clean cooperative
            shutdown. A dedicated route keeps the audit log honest
            and lets a peer worker re-claim the row within one poll
            cycle instead of waiting up to 15 minutes for the sweep.

        Same 409 contract as :func:`fail_task` — both routes share
        :func:`_conflict_response`, so the wire envelope a remote
        worker (TASK-022b3) reads on a lost race is identical
        regardless of which terminal-state RPC the conflict surfaced
        on. The repository's classification logic distinguishes the
        three cases (lost-update / wrong-status / row-gone) so the
        worker can branch cleanly:

        * ``actual_status == PENDING`` — the visibility-timeout sweep
          (or another worker's release) beat us to it; treat as
          idempotent-success and exit.
        * ``actual_status`` in (``DONE``, ``FAILED``, ``SKIPPED``) —
          the worker actually finished the task before the signal
          handler reached this RPC (extremely narrow race); the
          terminal status wins.

    """Reject cross-worker bearer use with 403 (TASK-101 scrutiny round-1 fix / VAL-AUTH-024).

    :func:`whilly.adapters.transport.auth.make_db_bearer_auth` stashes
    the DB-resolved ``worker_id`` on
    ``request.state.authenticated_worker_id`` when the per-worker hash
    lookup hits. This helper compares that resolved identity against
    the ``claimed_worker_id`` the route handler observed (from the
    request body or path) and raises 403 on mismatch — i.e. worker A's
    token cannot be used to ``heartbeat``/``claim``/``complete``/
    ``fail``/``release`` as worker B.

    Why 403 (not 401)?
        RFC 7235 §3.1 / RFC 6750 §3: 401 means "I don't know who you
        are"; 403 means "I know who you are, you can't do this". The
        token authenticated successfully — auth is *not* the failure;
        the *operation* is forbidden. VAL-AUTH-024's evidence clause
        accepts ``(400, 401, 403)``, so 403 is contract-compliant; we
        choose 403 to keep schema-validation 400s separate from
        authorisation 403s in operator dashboards / log queries.

    Legacy fallback (``WHILLY_WORKER_TOKEN`` shared bearer) — no-op
        On the legacy path the dep stashes ``None`` because the
        shared cluster token cannot identify a specific worker. We
        treat ``None`` as a no-op so the one-minor-version legacy
        compat window (VAL-AUTH-030/031/034) stays green: the legacy
        bearer is allowed to act as "any worker" exactly because
        identity is unknown. When the legacy fallback is removed in
        v4.2 this branch collapses (the dep itself will raise 401 on
        every non-DB-resolved request).

    Why a module-level helper rather than a FastAPI dependency?
        Each handler already extracts ``payload.worker_id`` from a
        typed request schema, so the comparison is one expression at
        the top of the handler. A separate ``Depends`` would have to
        re-parse the body or read the path parameter via ``Request``
        — twice the work for the same outcome. Inlining the call
        keeps the auth boundary explicit at the call site.

    Centralised because both ``complete_task`` and ``fail_task`` map
    the same exception with the same shape — and a future
    ``release_task`` HTTP endpoint will reuse it. Keeping the
    projection in one place means the wire contract for
    ``"version_conflict"`` lives in exactly one location, so a future
    schema change (extra fields, alternate error codes) lands without
    touching the routes.

    The ``error`` code is the stable machine-readable token; the
    ``detail`` is :func:`str(exc)`'s human-readable message — the same
    text that appears in server logs, which keeps debugging cheap when
    a remote worker reports a 409 from production.
