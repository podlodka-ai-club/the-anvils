"""Add ``funnel_url`` singleton table for the M2 localhost.run sidecar.

Adds a one-row table the funnel sidecar (m2-localhostrun-funnel-
sidecar) upserts on every reconnect with the latest assigned
``https://<random>.lhr.rocks`` URL. Workers re-discover the URL via
``SELECT url FROM funnel_url ORDER BY updated_at DESC LIMIT 1`` (or
``WHERE id = 1`` since the singleton invariant guarantees a single
row at most). The shared-volume file ``/funnel/url.txt`` is the
fallback for environments without postgres reachability.

Schema shape
------------
* ``id integer PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT 1`` — singleton key. The
  ``funnel_url_singleton`` CHECK pins ``id = 1`` so no second row
  can ever land. Sidecar upsert uses ``INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (id)
  DO UPDATE`` to overwrite the row in place on every URL rotation.
* ``url text NOT NULL`` — the latest published
  ``https://<random>.lhr.rocks`` URL.
* ``updated_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()`` — sidecar
  bumps this on every upsert; consumers (worker URL re-discovery,
  validator probes) order by it.

Why a singleton (vs. an append-only history)?
---------------------------------------------
The contract is "what is the live URL right now?" — historical URLs
are useful for forensics but not for routing. Keeping a single row
keeps the lookup query trivial (one PK lookup) and makes the
``ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE`` upsert race-free across multiple
sidecar restarts. The ``CHECK (id = 1)`` constraint at the schema
level is a belt-and-braces guarantee against future code that
forgets to pass ``id=1`` explicitly.

Why no FK / no per-tenant scoping?
----------------------------------
The funnel URL is a deployment-wide singleton (one control-plane
per deployment, one sidecar per control-plane). M2 does not
support multi-tenant funnel URLs; a future M5+ feature could
generalize this into a ``funnel_url(deployment_id, url, ...)``
table.

Reversibility
-------------
``downgrade()`` drops the table. After ``downgrade -1`` the schema
is byte-equal to revision 009 (table is gone, ``alembic_version``
rolls back to ``009_bootstrap_tokens``). Pinned by the alembic
full-chain test and by
``tests/integration/test_migration_010_funnel_url.py``.
