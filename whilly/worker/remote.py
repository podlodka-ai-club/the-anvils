"""Remote worker async-loop for Whilly v4.0 (TASK-022b1 / TASK-022b2 / TASK-022b3, PRD FR-1.1, FR-1.5, FR-1.6, NFR-1).

Counterpart to :mod:`whilly.worker.local`: same outer state-machine pattern
(``claim → run → complete | fail``), but every state-mutating step goes
through :class:`whilly.adapters.transport.client.RemoteWorkerClient` over
HTTP instead of touching :class:`whilly.adapters.db.repository.TaskRepository`
directly. The split keeps the worker process a thin httpx + pydantic +
:mod:`whilly.core` consumer (PRD FR-1.5) — there is no asyncpg / FastAPI
import path inside this module by design (PRD SC-6).

This module hosts two layered entry points:

* :func:`run_remote_worker` — the bare loop (TASK-022b1). One concern:
  ``claim → run → complete | fail`` over HTTP. ``stop`` is honoured at
  iteration boundaries and during the runner call so SIGTERM / SIGINT
  (TASK-022b3) returns the in-flight task to ``PENDING`` via
  :meth:`RemoteWorkerClient.release` instead of either failing it or
  waiting out the visibility-timeout sweep.
* :func:`run_remote_worker_with_heartbeat` — the composition root
  (TASK-022b2 / 022b3). Pairs the bare loop with a parallel heartbeat
  task under one :class:`asyncio.TaskGroup` *and* installs SIGTERM /
  SIGINT signal handlers that flip the shared shutdown event so the
  worker releases its in-flight task back to ``PENDING`` on a
  cooperative kill from a process supervisor (Kubernetes, systemd,
  tmux). Mirrors the local-worker ``run_worker`` from
  :mod:`whilly.worker.main`.

Loop contract (one iteration)
-----------------------------
1. ``client.claim(worker_id, plan.id)``. The server's long-poll budget
   (``CLAIM_LONG_POLL_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT`` = 30s) holds the connection open
   while the queue is empty. Two terminal outcomes:

   * ``Task`` — a row transitioned ``PENDING`` → ``CLAIMED`` server-side.
     The wire payload is already projected back to the domain
     :class:`Task` by :meth:`RemoteWorkerClient.claim`, so the rest of
     the loop speaks pure-domain types.
   * ``None`` — the long-poll budget expired. The AC pins the response:
     **re-poll immediately, no client-side sleep**. Adding a worker-side
     idle wait would double the budget on the server and burn worker
     capacity to no end; the supervisor's heartbeat (TASK-022b2) and
     signal handling (TASK-022b3) interleave between iterations, so the
     "tight re-poll" here is a feature, not a regression.

2. ``runner(task, prompt)``. Same callable shape as the local loop —
   :data:`RemoteRunnerCallable` is a structural alias matching
   :func:`whilly.adapters.runner.run_task`. The runner owns its own
   subprocess / retry policy; we just consume an :class:`AgentResult`.

3. Outcome routing:

   * ``is_complete=True`` and ``exit_code == 0`` →
     ``client.complete(task.id, worker_id, task.version)`` (server flips
     ``IN_PROGRESS`` → ``DONE``; see "protocol gap" note below).
   * Anything else → ``client.fail(task.id, worker_id, task.version,
     reason)``. The reason follows the local worker's shape so the
     dashboard / post-mortem queries can grep the same prefix
     (``exit_code=<n>: <truncated stdout>``).

Why no ``start`` step (and the protocol gap)
--------------------------------------------
The local worker calls :meth:`TaskRepository.start_task` between claim
and run to flip ``CLAIMED`` → ``IN_PROGRESS`` so the eventual
``complete_task`` SQL filter matches. The HTTP transport intentionally
does **not** expose ``/tasks/{id}/start`` today — TASK-022a2 / 022a3
shipped only the four worker RPCs the AC required (``register``,
``heartbeat``, ``claim``, ``complete``, ``fail``). Until a future task
adds a start endpoint (or relaxes the server's complete filter to accept
``CLAIMED`` too), a real run against the production server will surface
the gap as :class:`VersionConflictError` on ``complete`` with
``actual_status=CLAIMED``. We treat that the same as any other 409 here:
log and continue. The scope of TASK-022b1 is the loop *shape*, not the
wire-level start gap — the unit tests below use a stub client that
returns the post-update CompleteResponse so the loop logic is fully
exercised regardless of the gap.

Termination
-----------
Three exit paths:

* ``stop`` event set (graceful shutdown — TASK-022b3): if the event
  fires *between* iterations the loop exits cleanly without an
  in-flight task to release; if it fires *during* the runner call the
  runner is cancelled and the in-flight task is returned to
  ``PENDING`` via :meth:`RemoteWorkerClient.release` so a peer (or
  this worker on restart) can re-claim it within one poll cycle.
* ``max_iterations`` (test-only) hard cap on outer iterations.
* Outer :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` from the supervisor.

When ``stop`` is ``None`` (legacy callers, the heartbeat-composition
root in 022b2 before signals were wired) the loop runs without the
shutdown race — the original 022b1 codepath, untouched, so unit tests
that pre-date 022b3 still exercise the bare contract.

Concurrency note (PRD FR-2.4)
-----------------------------
Three writers can race for any task row even on the remote path: this
worker, a peer worker that claimed after a sweep release, and the
visibility-timeout sweep itself (TASK-025a). The optimistic-locking
contract surfaces every lost race as 409 :class:`VersionConflictError`,
which we log and skip. Abandoning the row is the safe move because by
the time the conflict surfaces another writer (sweep or peer) has
already taken responsibility for it.

    reached (the ``--once`` CLI flag from TASK-022c), or when the outer
    task is cancelled (production fallback).

    Parameters
    ----------
    client:
        Open :class:`RemoteWorkerClient` — the caller is responsible for
        the surrounding ``async with`` block. Reusing one client across
        iterations is the documented hot path: keep-alive lets the
        long-polled ``claim`` reuse a warm TCP connection on the next
        iteration.
    runner:
        Coroutine ``(task, prompt) -> AgentResult``. Same shape as the
        local worker; production callers pass
        :func:`whilly.adapters.runner.run_task`, tests pass an async
        closure.
    plan:
        Plan whose tasks the worker draws from. Only ``plan.id`` hits
        the wire; the full plan is forwarded to
        :func:`whilly.core.prompts.build_task_prompt` for the agent
        prompt context — same projection as the local worker.
    worker_id:
        Identity returned by :meth:`RemoteWorkerClient.register` on a
        previous run (or registered out-of-band). Echoed in every claim
        / complete / fail body for defence-in-depth and audit-log
        correlation.
    max_iterations:
        Hard cap on outer iterations. ``None`` (production default)
        means loop forever — exit only on cancellation or ``stop``.
        Tests pass an integer to make the loop terminable without
        wiring a stop event through the bare loop signature.
    max_processed:
        Hard cap on the number of tasks successfully passed to either
        ``client.complete`` or ``client.fail`` during this invocation.
        ``None`` (production default) means uncapped — completed and
        failed tasks accrue until ``stop`` / ``max_iterations`` /
        cancellation. ``1`` is the ``--once`` CLI flag's wire (TASK-022c):
        the loop runs until it processes (completes or fails) one
        task, then exits cleanly without releasing anything. Idle
        polls (204 from the server) and 409 lost-race iterations do
        **not** count as processed — they don't change the row's
        terminal status, so a ``--once`` worker fights through an
        empty queue or version skew until it actually owns a task.
    stop:
        Optional :class:`asyncio.Event` for cooperative graceful shutdown
        (TASK-022b3). When set, the loop releases any in-flight task
        back to ``PENDING`` via :meth:`RemoteWorkerClient.release` and
        exits. Wired up by :func:`run_remote_worker_with_heartbeat` to
        SIGTERM / SIGINT in production; tests set it directly to
        exercise the shutdown path without sending real signals.

async def run_remote_heartbeat_loop(

    *,
    interval: float = DEFAULT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL,
    stop: asyncio.Event,
) -> None:
    """Refresh ``workers.last_heartbeat`` over HTTP every ``interval`` seconds.

    Mirror of :func:`whilly.worker.main.run_heartbeat_loop` for the
    remote-worker side of the house. Two structural differences from the
    local-worker heartbeat:

    * The state-mutating call goes through
      :meth:`RemoteWorkerClient.heartbeat` (POST
      ``/workers/{id}/heartbeat``), not a direct
      :meth:`TaskRepository.update_heartbeat` SQL update. The server is
      what actually advances the column; from the worker's perspective
      heartbeat is just an RPC.
    * The set of "expected" failure modes is broader — every
      :class:`whilly.adapters.transport.client.HTTPClientError` subclass
      (auth, version-conflict-which-cannot-happen-here, server) plus raw
      :class:`OSError` / :class:`asyncio.TimeoutError` from httpx all
      count as transient and get logged + retried on the next tick.

    The first tick fires immediately on entry so a freshly-started
    worker shows a fresh ``last_heartbeat`` from the moment its main
    loop begins polling — same rationale as the local-worker heartbeat:
    no one-interval gap where the visibility-timeout sweep could mistake
    a brand-new worker for a stale one.

    Subsequent waits use :func:`asyncio.wait_for` against ``stop.wait()``
    so a graceful shutdown (TASK-022b3 SIGTERM, ``max_iterations``
    reached, outer cancellation propagated through ``_worker_then_stop``)
    wakes up the loop without waiting out the full interval.
    :class:`TimeoutError` is the "interval elapsed, tick again" path; a
    normal return from :func:`asyncio.wait_for` means ``stop`` fired and
    we exit cleanly — no :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` plumbing needed
    for the TaskGroup to unwind.

    Failure isolation
    -----------------
    Heartbeat is **best-effort liveness** (PRD FR-1.6). A failed tick
    must not kill the worker — the visibility-timeout sweep (TASK-025a)
    will eventually reclaim an in-flight task whose worker stopped
    heartbeating, and that's a recoverable problem; crashing the worker
    over a transient server hiccup trades it for an unrecoverable one.

    The except clause catches :class:`Exception` (so every concrete
    httpx / typed error flows through), but **not**
    :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` — that inherits from
    :class:`BaseException`, so structured cancellation still works if
    the supervisor decides to cancel the task explicitly. We also
    surface a recoverable ``ok=False`` from the server (worker row
    missing — the supervisor's job to re-register, see
    :class:`whilly.adapters.transport.schemas.HeartbeatResponse`) at
    INFO so an operator can spot misconfigured ``WHILLY_WORKER_TOKEN`` /
    revoked rows in the journal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    client:
        Open :class:`RemoteWorkerClient` — the caller (the supervisor)
        owns the surrounding ``async with`` block. Reusing one client
        for both the main loop's claim/complete RPCs and the heartbeat
        is intentional: httpx's pooled :class:`httpx.AsyncClient`
        multiplexes the requests over the keep-alive connection.
    worker_id:
        Identifier returned by :meth:`RemoteWorkerClient.register` on
        a previous run. Sent in the heartbeat body for the server's
        per-row UPDATE filter.
    interval:
        Seconds between heartbeat ticks. Defaults to
        :data:`DEFAULT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` (30s, PRD FR-1.6). Tests pass
        a tiny value so the heartbeat ticks observably during a
        millisecond-scoped run.
    stop:
        Shared shutdown event. Set by the supervisor when the main loop
        exits (``finally: stop.set()`` inside ``_worker_then_stop``) so
        the heartbeat returns cleanly without external cancellation.

    Composition root for the remote worker — the layered counterpart to

    coroutines run under one :class:`asyncio.TaskGroup`; when the main
    worker loop returns (``max_iterations`` reached in tests, outer
    cancellation propagated, or a SIGTERM / SIGINT -flipped ``stop``
    event in production) the inner closure's ``finally`` block sets the
    shared :class:`asyncio.Event`, the heartbeat coroutine wakes from
    its ``wait_for(stop, interval)`` and returns cleanly, and the
    TaskGroup unwinds without :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` plumbing.

    Signal handling (TASK-022b3)
    ----------------------------
    When ``install_signal_handlers=True`` (production default),
    :func:`run_remote_worker_with_heartbeat` installs handlers for
    SIGTERM and SIGINT via :meth:`asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.add_signal_handler`.
    Both flip the same ``stop`` event the heartbeat / loop already use.
    The inner :func:`run_remote_worker` races each runner call against
    ``stop`` and, on a mid-runner shutdown, calls
    :meth:`RemoteWorkerClient.release` to put the in-flight task back to
    ``PENDING`` before exiting. Net effect: a peer worker (or this
    worker on restart) re-claims it within one poll cycle, no work is
    lost, and the audit log carries a ``RELEASE`` event with
    ``payload.reason = "shutdown"`` so post-mortems can tell signal-
    driven releases apart from visibility-timeout sweeps.

    Handlers are installed only on the main thread of an asyncio loop
    that supports them — Windows' ``ProactorEventLoop`` and any non-
    main thread raise :class:`NotImplementedError` from
    ``add_signal_handler``. We catch that and silently degrade: callers
    in those environments still get heartbeats and can shut down via
    ``max_iterations`` / outer cancellation. The
    ``install_signal_handlers=False`` parameter is the test-side toggle
    — pytest's own SIGINT handler must not be replaced by the worker's
    during unit tests.

    Why a stop event rather than ``heartbeat_task.cancel()``?
        Same rationale as :mod:`whilly.worker.main`: explicit
        cancellation surfaces a :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` from
        the cancelled task that :class:`asyncio.TaskGroup` treats as a
        propagatable error. Using a stop event lets the heartbeat exit
        *normally* — the TaskGroup just awaits both children, sees
        clean returns, and drops out. The signal handlers set the same
        event from inside the asyncio loop via
        ``loop.add_signal_handler``, so a ``kill -TERM`` arrives as
        ordinary cooperative shutdown.

    Parameters
    ----------
    client:
        Open :class:`RemoteWorkerClient`. The caller owns the
        surrounding ``async with`` block — heartbeat and main loop
        share one pooled connection, so the supervisor outlives both.
    runner:
        Coroutine ``(task, prompt) -> AgentResult``. Forwarded to
        :func:`run_remote_worker` unchanged — this layer doesn't touch
        the per-iteration contract.
    plan:
        The plan whose tasks the worker draws from. Forwarded.
    worker_id:
        Registered worker identity. Used by both the main loop
        (claim/complete/fail/release bodies) and the heartbeat task.
    heartbeat_interval:
        Seconds between heartbeat ticks. Defaults to
        :data:`DEFAULT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` (30s).
    max_iterations:
        Hard cap on outer iterations of the main loop. ``None`` means
        loop until cancellation or shutdown. Tests pass an integer to
        make the composition terminable without wiring a cancellation
        token through the bare loop's signature.
    max_processed:
        Hard cap on completed + failed tasks. ``None`` means uncapped;
        ``1`` is the wire for the ``whilly-worker --once`` CLI flag
        (TASK-022c). Forwarded to :func:`run_remote_worker` unchanged

    install_signal_handlers:
        When ``True`` (production default), SIGTERM and SIGINT are
        installed via :meth:`asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.add_signal_handler`
        and flip the shared ``stop`` event. Tests pass ``False`` to
        avoid clobbering pytest's own SIGINT handler (and to keep unit
        tests deterministic across loop implementations).
    stop:
        Optional shared shutdown event. Callers that already own a
        shutdown signal (CLI in TASK-022c, integration tests that
        drive shutdown without sending real signals) pass it in;
        otherwise we allocate one internally. Either way the same
        event drives the heartbeat termination, the main-loop
        release-on-shutdown path, and the signal handlers.

    Returns
    -------
    RemoteWorkerStats
        Counters returned by the inner :func:`run_remote_worker`. The
        heartbeat is a side-effect on the server (and on
        ``workers.last_heartbeat`` once it lands in Postgres) and
        does not contribute to any counter; signal-driven releases
        surface via ``RemoteWorkerStats.released_on_shutdown`` — same
        convention as the local-worker composition.
