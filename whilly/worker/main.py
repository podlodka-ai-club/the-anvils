"""Local worker composition root with heartbeat + signals (TASK-019b1/b2, PRD FR-1.6, NFR-1).

This module is one notch up the composition stack from
:mod:`whilly.worker.local`. ``local.run_local_worker`` is the bare claim →
start → run → complete loop; the present module pairs it with a parallel
heartbeat task under a single :class:`asyncio.TaskGroup`, plus SIGTERM /
SIGINT signal handlers (TASK-019b2) that flip a shared shutdown event so
the worker releases its in-flight task back to ``PENDING`` and exits
cleanly when the process supervisor kills it.

Why a separate module rather than folding heartbeat into
:mod:`whilly.worker.local`?
    The 019a slice is intentionally I/O-narrow — one concern, one queue
    of repo calls, exhaustive unit-test coverage. Heartbeat adds a second
    independent concurrency dimension (it ticks regardless of whether a
    task is in flight). Keeping it here means each module stays small
    enough to reason about in isolation, and TASK-019c's CLI can
    substitute either entry point without rewiring the inner loop.

Liveness contract (PRD FR-1.4 / FR-1.6)
---------------------------------------
The visibility-timeout sweep (TASK-009d / TASK-025) reclaims rows whose
``claimed_at`` predates ``NOW() - visibility_timeout`` — but ``claimed_at``
is set once at claim time, so a long-running agent would look stale to the
sweep without an independent liveness signal. ``workers.last_heartbeat`` is
that signal: every :data:`DEFAULT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` seconds the worker
refreshes its row, and the sweep / dashboard read it to decide which workers
are alive. 30s gives ~30 heartbeats of headroom inside the default 15-minute
visibility timeout.

TaskGroup composition
---------------------
:func:`run_worker` pins both coroutines to one :class:`asyncio.TaskGroup`:

* The main worker task delegates straight to
  :func:`whilly.worker.local.run_local_worker` and stamps an
  :class:`asyncio.Event` (``stop``) on exit so the heartbeat coroutine
  can wind down without external cancellation.
* The heartbeat task loops ``update_heartbeat`` + ``wait_for(stop, interval)``
  until ``stop`` fires.

Why a stop event rather than ``heartbeat_task.cancel()``?
    Explicit cancellation surfaces a :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` from
    the cancelled task, which :class:`asyncio.TaskGroup` treats as a
    cancellation request that should propagate. Using a stop event lets
    the heartbeat exit *normally* — the TaskGroup just awaits both
    children, sees clean returns, and unwinds without exception
    plumbing. The SIGTERM / SIGINT signal handlers (TASK-019b2) set the
    same event from inside the asyncio loop via
    ``loop.add_signal_handler``, so a ``kill -TERM`` arrives as ordinary
    cooperative shutdown rather than a default-disposition process kill.

Signal handling (TASK-019b2)
----------------------------
``run_worker`` installs handlers for SIGTERM and SIGINT via
:meth:`asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.add_signal_handler`. Both flip the same
``stop`` event the heartbeat / loop already use. The inner
``run_local_worker`` races each runner call against ``stop`` and, on a
mid-runner shutdown, calls :meth:`TaskRepository.release_task` to put the
in-flight task back to ``PENDING`` before exiting. Net effect: a peer
worker (or this worker on restart) re-claims it within one poll cycle, no
work is lost, and the audit log carries a ``RELEASE`` event with
``payload.reason = "shutdown"`` so post-mortems can tell signal-driven
releases apart from visibility-timeout sweeps.

Handlers are installed only on the main thread of an asyncio loop that
supports them — Windows' ``ProactorEventLoop`` and any non-main thread
raise :class:`NotImplementedError` from ``add_signal_handler``. We catch
that and silently degrade: callers in those environments still get
heartbeats and can shut down via ``max_iterations`` / outer cancellation.
The ``install_signal_handlers=False`` parameter is the test-side toggle —
pytest's own SIGINT handler must not be replaced by the worker's during
unit tests.

Failure isolation
-----------------
A single ``update_heartbeat`` exception (network blip, transient
asyncpg disconnect) is logged and the loop ticks again — heartbeat is
strictly best-effort and must never kill the worker. The repository
already returns ``False`` rather than raising on a missing worker row;
real exceptions are unexpected enough to log loudly without giving the
loop the satisfaction of crashing the whole TaskGroup over them.

    The first tick fires immediately so a freshly-started worker shows
    a fresh ``last_heartbeat`` from the moment its main loop begins
    polling — no one-interval gap where the sweep could mistake a brand-
    new worker for a stale one.

    Subsequent waits use :func:`asyncio.wait_for` against ``stop.wait()``
    so a graceful shutdown wakes up the loop without waiting out the full
    interval. ``TimeoutError`` is the "interval elapsed, tick again"
    path; a normal return from the wait means ``stop`` fired and we
    exit.

    Heartbeat exceptions are intentionally swallowed (logged at
    WARNING). Heartbeat is best-effort liveness — if it fails, the
    worker stays alive and the visibility-timeout sweep will eventually
    reclaim the in-flight task; killing the worker over a transient
    update failure trades a recoverable problem for an unrecoverable
    one. :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` is *not* swallowed (re-raised

    Parameters
    ----------
    repo, runner, plan, worker_id, idle_wait, max_iterations:
        Forwarded to :func:`whilly.worker.local.run_local_worker`. See
        that function for the full per-iteration contract.
    heartbeat_interval:
        Seconds between heartbeat ticks. Defaults to
        :data:`DEFAULT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` (30s). Tests pass a small
        value so the heartbeat ticks observably during a short test run.
    install_signal_handlers:
        When ``True`` (production default), SIGTERM and SIGINT are
        installed via :meth:`asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.add_signal_handler`
        and flip the shared ``stop`` event. Tests pass ``False`` to
        avoid clobbering pytest's own SIGINT handler (and to keep unit
        tests deterministic across loop implementations).
    stop:
        Optional shared shutdown event. Callers that already own a
        shutdown signal (CLI in TASK-019c, integration tests that drive
        shutdown without sending real signals) pass it in; otherwise
        ``run_worker`` allocates one internally. Either way the same
        event is forwarded to ``run_local_worker`` and to the heartbeat
        loop.

    Returns
    -------
    WorkerStats
        The :class:`whilly.worker.local.WorkerStats` returned by the
        inner loop — same fields, same semantics. The heartbeat is a
        side-effect on ``workers.last_heartbeat`` and does not show up
        in the stats counters; signal-driven releases are surfaced via
        ``WorkerStats.released_on_shutdown``.
