"""Local worker async-loop for Whilly v4.0 (TASK-019a, PRD FR-1.6, FR-2.2).

This module is the first composer that ties :mod:`whilly.core` (pure
domain), :mod:`whilly.adapters.db` (Postgres :class:`TaskRepository`) and
:mod:`whilly.adapters.runner` (Claude CLI subprocess) into a unit that
actually runs tasks. The 019a slice was deliberately minimal — no heartbeat,
no signal handling, no CLI; those land in 019b1 / 019b2 / 019c respectively.
TASK-019b2 layered cooperative shutdown on top via an optional ``stop``
event without touching the inner state-transition logic, so the testable
surface stays small enough to exercise exhaustively without spinning up
Postgres or the ``claude`` binary.

Loop contract
-------------
:func:`run_local_worker` is the public entry point. One iteration:

1. ``repo.claim_task(worker_id, plan.id)`` — atomically grab one PENDING
   task, transitioning it to CLAIMED. Returns ``None`` when the queue is
   empty (or every candidate is locked by a peer).
2. ``repo.start_task(task.id, version)`` — flip CLAIMED → IN_PROGRESS so
   the eventual ``complete_task`` passes its ``status = 'IN_PROGRESS'``
   filter. A :class:`VersionConflictError` here means the
   visibility-timeout sweep released the task before we got to it; we drop
   and continue.
3. ``runner(task, prompt)`` — invoke the agent with the prompt built by
   :func:`whilly.core.prompts.build_task_prompt`. The runner is responsible
   for its own retry / error handling (see
   :mod:`whilly.adapters.runner.claude_cli`); we get back a fully-formed
   :class:`AgentResult`.
4. Outcome routing:

   * ``is_complete=True`` and ``exit_code == 0`` →
     ``repo.complete_task(...)`` (IN_PROGRESS → DONE).
   * Anything else → ``repo.fail_task(reason=...)`` (IN_PROGRESS →
     FAILED), with the reason carrying the exit code and a truncated
     stdout snippet so dashboards / post-mortems don't have to dig
     through worker logs.

When ``claim_task`` returns ``None`` we sleep ``idle_wait`` seconds and
poll again — the documented "idle wait → repeat poll" path from the AC.

Termination
-----------
Three exit paths, in order of precedence:

1. **Graceful shutdown via ``stop`` event** (TASK-019b2). When the optional
   :class:`asyncio.Event` argument fires, the loop checks it at every
   safe boundary (top of iteration, after an idle sleep) and exits
   cleanly. If the event fires *during* the runner call, the runner is
   cancelled and the in-flight task is released back to ``PENDING``
   via :meth:`TaskRepository.release_task` so a peer (or this worker on
   restart) can pick it up — no lost work, no aged-out claim waiting on
   the visibility-timeout sweep.
2. ``max_iterations`` (test-only). Hard cap on outer iterations.
3. Outer :class:`asyncio.CancelledError`. Production fallback if the
   composer cancels the task without setting ``stop`` first.

Production callers (``run_worker`` in :mod:`whilly.worker.main`) wire
``stop`` to the SIGTERM / SIGINT signal handlers so a kill from the
process supervisor triggers path #1.

Concurrency note (PRD FR-2.4)
-----------------------------
Three writers can race for any task row: this worker, a peer worker after a
sweep release, and the visibility-timeout sweep itself. The state-machine
+ optimistic-locking lattice means *exactly one* of them wins any given
state transition. Whenever this worker loses a race we get a
:class:`VersionConflictError` from the repository — we log and continue
rather than crashing the loop, because by the time the conflict surfaces
another writer has already taken responsibility for the row. Abandoning is
the safe, correct thing to do.

    ----------
    iterations:

    failed:
        Tasks marked ``FAILED`` via :meth:`TaskRepository.fail_task` because
        the agent didn't emit ``<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`` or returned a
        non-zero exit code.
    idle_polls:
        Iterations where ``claim_task`` returned ``None`` and the loop
        slept ``idle_wait`` seconds before polling again.
    released_on_shutdown:
        Tasks the worker put back to ``PENDING`` via
        :meth:`TaskRepository.release_task` because a shutdown signal
        arrived mid-runner (TASK-019b2). Always 0 in legacy non-stop runs;
        at most 1 per ``run_local_worker`` invocation since the loop
        breaks out after the release.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repo:
        Postgres-backed task repository. The worker calls
        :meth:`~whilly.adapters.db.repository.TaskRepository.claim_task`,
        :meth:`~whilly.adapters.db.repository.TaskRepository.start_task`,
        :meth:`~whilly.adapters.db.repository.TaskRepository.complete_task`,
        :meth:`~whilly.adapters.db.repository.TaskRepository.fail_task`,
        and :meth:`~whilly.adapters.db.repository.TaskRepository.release_task`.
    runner:
        Coroutine ``(task, prompt) -> AgentResult``. In production this is
        :func:`whilly.adapters.runner.run_task`; tests pass a stub that
        returns canned :class:`AgentResult` values.
    plan:
        Plan whose tasks are eligible for claim. Only ``plan.id`` is read
        for ``claim_task``; the full plan is forwarded to
        :func:`whilly.core.prompts.build_task_prompt` so the agent has
        plan-level context (name, id) without an extra DB round-trip.
    worker_id:
        Identity passed to ``claim_task``. Must already exist in the
        ``workers`` table — the registration flow is owned by TASK-021b.
        Tests insert a fixture row directly.
    idle_wait:
        Seconds to ``asyncio.sleep`` between polls when the queue is
        empty. Defaults to :data:`DEFAULT_IDLE_WAIT`. When ``stop`` is
        provided, the sleep wakes early on shutdown so SIGTERM doesn't
        have to wait out the full interval.
    max_iterations:
        Hard cap on outer-loop iterations. ``None`` (production default)
        means loop forever — exit only on cancellation or ``stop``. Tests
        pass an integer to make the loop terminable.
    stop:
        Optional :class:`asyncio.Event` for cooperative graceful shutdown.
        When the event fires, the loop releases any in-flight task back
        to ``PENDING`` via :meth:`TaskRepository.release_task` and exits.
        Wired up by :func:`whilly.worker.main.run_worker` to SIGTERM /
        SIGINT in production; tests set it directly to exercise the
        shutdown path without sending real signals.
